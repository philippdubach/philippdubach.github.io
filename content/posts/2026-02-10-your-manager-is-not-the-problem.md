faq:
- question: "How common is top-down sabotage by managers?"
  answer: "According to a 2024 Harvard Business School study by Zaman and Lakhani surveying 335 U.S. executives, 71% had witnessed top-down sabotage during their careers, 30% observed it in their current organization, 28% had been victims, and 5% admitted to sabotaging their own direct reports."
- question: "What motivates managers to sabotage talented employees?"
  answer: "Status threat, not money, is the primary driver. Only 3.3% of executives attributed sabotage to monetary concerns alone, while 21% pointed to status concerns and 24% cited both. Managers view high-performing subordinates as future competitors for promotions or replacement risks."
- question: "How does managerial discretion affect sabotage rates?"
  answer: "In firms using relative performance evaluations where managers had significant subjective discretion over identifying outperformers, the sabotage rate reached 46.8%. In RPE firms without such discretion, it dropped to 26.9%. Reducing subjective discretion nearly halves sabotage rates."
- question: "What is the cost of managerial sabotage to organizations?"
  answer: "Gallup estimates poor management costs the U.S. economy $960 billion to $1.2 trillion per year. 75% of voluntary turnover traces to managerial issues, and the most talented employees, those with the most options, leave first, creating a negative selection effect."
- question: "What structural interventions reduce managerial sabotage?"
  answer: "Research supports three interventions: (1) reducing managerial discretion through transparent, standardized evaluation criteria; (2) implementing regular skip-level meetings so managerial behavior becomes visible to leadership; and (3) rewarding talent export, since managers who promote team members attract 8.9% more internal applications and 11.6% more top-rated applicants."

>The 5% who admitted to sabotaging their reports are just the ones who said so out loud.

Most people who've worked in a large organization have a story about a boss who buried a talented report. Withheld credit. Blocked a transfer. Gave the plum assignment to someone less capable. The standard explanation is character: some managers are insecure, petty, or incompetent. [New research from Harvard Business School](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-drives-managers-to-sabotage-talented-employees) suggests the standard explanation is wrong. The problem isn't bad people. It's rational behavior inside badly designed systems.

## The Harvard study that put numbers on it

[Hashim Zaman and Karim Lakhani](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4941749) surveyed 335 U.S. corporate executives and ran a behavioral experiment. The headline numbers: **71%** had witnessed top-down sabotage during their careers. **30%** observed it in their current organization. **28%** had been victims. And **5%** openly admitted to doing it themselves, a number that, given the social desirability of not confessing to professional sabotage in a survey, almost certainly understates reality.

The motivational breakdown is the interesting part. Only **3.3%** attributed sabotage to monetary concerns alone. **21%** pointed to status. **24%** cited both. Managers aren't torpedoing their best people for a bigger bonus. They're doing it because a talented subordinate represents a future peer, a competitor for the next promotion, or a replacement risk. As Zaman put it: they have an incentive to mitigate your growth ahead of time. This is not irrational. Within the rules of the game they're playing, it's strategic. {{< img src="sabotage-motivation-breakdown.png" alt="Horizontal bar chart showing managerial sabotage motivation breakdown: 24% status and money combined, 21% status alone, 3.3% money alone, with 51.7% other or unclear. Status-related motives dominate monetary concerns by a factor of six." width="80%" >}}

The behavioral experiment sharpened the finding. Under absolute performance pay, **90%** of participants chose the more talented partner for a collaborative task. Under relative performance pay, where your compensation depends on outperforming the other person, that dropped to **60%**. Some participants explicitly stated they chose the weaker partner to avoid competition. Others went further and stole the unchosen person's work.

Here's where it gets structural. In firms using [relative performance evaluations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_performance_evaluation) (RPEs) where managers had significant subjective discretion over identifying outperformers, the sabotage rate hit **46.8%**. In RPE firms without that discretion, it fell to **26.9%**. Giving managers the power to decide who counts as a top performer nearly doubles the rate at which they sabotage those performers. The discretion designed to make evaluation flexible becomes the weapon used to distort it. {{< img src="discretion-doubles-sabotage.png" alt="Side-by-side comparison showing sabotage rates in RPE firms: 26.9% with standardized criteria versus 46.8% with subjective managerial discretion, a 74% increase. Discretion nearly doubles sabotage." width="80%" >}}

## The Salieri Syndrome is older than the data and worse than you think

This isn't a new phenomenon, just a newly quantified one. [Duffy and Shaw (2000)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/104649640003100101) named it the Salieri Syndrome, after the court composer who, in the dramatized telling at least, recognized Mozart's genius and systematically undermined it while posing as a mentor. Their longitudinal study of 143 groups found that envy directly reduced group performance. More recently, [Yu, Duffy, and Tepper (2018)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320201015_Consequences_of_Downward_Envy_A_Model_of_Self-esteem_Threat_Abusive_Supervision_and_Supervisory_Leader_Self-improvement) demonstrated something previously assumed impossible: downward envy, where supervisors envy their own subordinates. Whether that envy became destructive or constructive depended on a single variable: whether the supervisor perceived the subordinate as warm or cold. Warmth channeled envy into self-improvement. Coldness channeled it into abuse.

## The best people leave first, and the math is brutal

The organizational costs are not subtle. [Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/349484/state-of-the-global-workplace.aspx) estimates that poor management costs the U.S. economy between **$960 billion and $1.2 trillion per year**, and that **75%** of voluntary turnover traces to managerial issues. The mechanism is selective attrition: talented employees have options and exercise them first. The mediocre stay. [Ingrid Hägele's research](https://www.brianheger.com/talent-hoarding-in-organizations-two-researched-based-studies/) at LMU Munich found that when managers are temporarily rotated out, applications for internal promotions from their teams jump **123%**. That number implies a vast, ongoing suppression of mobility that's invisible until you remove the bottleneck. {{< img src="sabotage-organizational-cost.png" alt="Data table showing organizational costs of managerial sabotage: $960B–1.2T annual U.S. cost, 75% of turnover manager-driven, 123% jump in internal applications when hoarding managers rotate out, and managers who develop talent attract 8.9% more applications" width="80%" >}}

## What actually works: structure, not inspiration

The contrarian read on all of this: we've spent decades building management training programs, leadership development curricula, and corporate values posters that treat sabotage as a character deficiency. The data says it's an incentive problem. You don't fix incentive problems with inspirational messaging.

Three structural interventions that the research actually supports: (1) reduce managerial discretion over evaluations, since transparent, standardized criteria cut sabotage rates nearly in half; (2) implement skip-level meetings as a regular practice, not as an escalation mechanism, so that managerial behavior becomes visible to the layer above; and (3) reward talent export. [Keller and Dlugos found](https://fortune.com/2024/01/31/the-talent-conundrum-managers-may-be-tempted-to-hold-onto-their-best-employees-but-that-actually-hurts-the-entire-company/) that managers who promoted team members at higher rates received **8.9% more internal applications** and **11.6% more applications from top-rated employees**. Letting people go made those managers more attractive to work for. The talent came to them.

The Zaman and Lakhani study identified organizational culture as the single biggest mitigating factor. But culture isn't a cause. It's an outcome. You get a culture of trust by building systems where trust is the rational strategy. Right now, in most hierarchical organizations, sabotaging your best report is the rational strategy. The 5% who admit it are just the ones who said so out loud.
