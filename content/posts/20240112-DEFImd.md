faq:
- question: How much institutional capital has entered DeFi protocols?
  answer: Institutional capital in DeFi reached approximately $42 billion in total exposure by 2024, with firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton participating through tokenized treasuries and liquidity provisioning. BlackRock's BUIDL tokenized fund alone grew from $40 million at its March 2024 launch to over $2 billion by end of 2025.
- question: What is the difference between Total Value Locked and Total Value Redeemable?
  answer: Total Value Locked (TVL) measures all assets deposited in DeFi protocols, but not all locked value is immediately liquid. Researchers now prefer Total Value Redeemable (TVR), which accounts only for value that users can actually withdraw, giving a more accurate picture of protocol health and liquidity.
- question: Why are cross-chain bridges considered high-risk in DeFi?
  answer: Cross-chain bridges aggregate large amounts of value while relying on complex, less battle-tested code. Approximately 50% of all DeFi exploits target bridges, with losses exceeding $2.5 billion over two years. Notable incidents include the $350 million Wormhole exploit and the $81 million Orbit Chain failure.
- question: How does Europe's MiCA regulation treat DeFi protocols?
  answer: MiCA, which took full effect in late 2024, exempts DeFi services that are fully decentralized with no intermediaries. However, the definition of fully decentralized remains unclear, and many DeFi protocols rely on intermediaries that may bring them within regulatory scope. The EU plans additional DeFi-specific regulation in 2026.
- question: Which Layer 2 solutions dominate DeFi scaling?
  answer: Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base process nearly 90% of all Layer 2 transactions. Arbitrum holds about 41% of Layer 2 TVL at $16.6 billion as of January 2026. Zero-knowledge proof technology has further advanced L2 capabilities, reducing compliance costs by an estimated 30%.

A new academic review by Ali Farhani reveals that institutional Total Value Locked in DeFi protocols hit $42 billion in 2024, with BlackRock leading the charge by launching a $250 million tokenized fund on Centrifuge.

The numbers tell a remarkable story of maturation. Layer 2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum now dominate the scaling landscape, while zero-knowledge proofs have reduced compliance costs by 30%. Even the terminology is evolving—researchers now discuss "Total Value Redeemable" instead of the traditional TVL metric, acknowledging that not all locked value is immediately liquid. Despite technological advances, security incidents persist with painful regularity: $350 million lost in the Wormhole bridge exploit, $81 million in Orbit Chain's multi-signature failure. Cross-chain bridges remain "high-risk attack targets," a sobering reminder that connecting different blockchains is still more art than science. The regulatory landscape is complicated as well. Europe's MiCA regulation provides clear frameworks, while the SEC maintains its enforcement-first approach. Hong Kong's innovation sandbox offers a third path, balancing experimentation with oversight.

> DeFi is transitioning from a disruptive experiment to an integrated component of the global financial system

That transition isn't complete—Layer 2 solutions are projected to host over 70% of DeFi TVL by mid-2025—but the direction is clear.
