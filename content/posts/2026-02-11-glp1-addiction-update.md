faq:
- question: "Can GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic treat alcohol addiction?"
  answer: "Early evidence is promising. A Phase 2 RCT published in JAMA Psychiatry (Hendershot et al., 2025) found that semaglutide produced medium-to-large effect sizes for reduced alcohol consumption and cravings in 48 adults with alcohol use disorder, even at sub-therapeutic doses. A separate trial by Joseph Schacht found that participants on semaglutide halved their daily intake. However, no Phase 3 trials have been completed, and the longest RCT to date lasted only 9 weeks."
- question: "Do GLP-1 drugs make people stop drinking entirely?"
  answer: "No. The most striking finding across trials is that GLP-1 receptor agonists induce moderation rather than abstinence. In Schacht's trial, participants on semaglutide were not more likely to abstain from alcohol. They simply drank less. Heavy drinking days fell from roughly two-thirds to one-quarter, but participants continued drinking at lower levels."
- question: "What is the largest study of GLP-1s for alcohol use disorder?"
  answer: "The largest study is a Swedish national registry analysis by Lähteenvuo et al., published in JAMA Psychiatry in November 2024. It tracked 227,868 individuals with alcohol use disorder over a median of 8.8 years using a within-individual design. Semaglutide was associated with a 36% reduction in AUD-related hospitalization (aHR 0.64). Standard approved AUD medications showed no statistically significant effect in the same analysis."
- question: "Can GLP-1 drugs help with opioid addiction?"
  answer: "Preclinical evidence is strong. Penn State researchers found that liraglutide reduced fentanyl-seeking behavior in rats and suppressed withdrawal signaling in the locus coeruleus. A small human trial (n=20) showed 40% fewer opioid cravings with liraglutide versus placebo. A larger trial combining semaglutide with methadone or buprenorphine is currently underway."
- question: "How do GLP-1 drugs work on addiction in the brain?"
  answer: "GLP-1 receptor agonists appear to act on the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, the brain's reward system. They limit dopamine spikes triggered by addictive substances without reducing baseline dopamine levels. In neuroscience terms, they may dampen 'wanting' (compulsive drive) without diminishing 'liking' (capacity for pleasure), explaining why users report reduced cravings rather than anhedonia."
- question: "What are the risks of using GLP-1 drugs for addiction?"
  answer: "Key concerns include potential anhedonia (reduced capacity for pleasure) in a small minority, possible tolerance development observed in animal studies, unknown long-term durability, and significant weight loss in patients who may not need it. The European Medicines Agency found no causal link between GLP-1s and suicidal ideation, and the FDA in January 2026 requested that suicide warnings be removed from GLP-1 labels."

>The converging evidence is unusual and difficult to dismiss. But nearly all positive human data still comes from small, short trials or observational studies. This is an update, not a conclusion.

Three months ago I wrote about the [early evidence for GLP-1 receptor agonists as potential treatments for alcohol and substance use disorders](/posts/glp-1-receptor-agonists-in-asud-treatment/). At the time, the data amounted to a single small Phase 2 trial, preclinical work in rodents, and a promising but limited set of observational findings. Since then the evidence base has expanded meaningfully, and a [New Yorker article by Dhruv Khullar](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2026/02/16/can-ozempic-cure-addiction) brings together the latest research with personal accounts that illustrate what these drugs might actually be doing in the brain. There is a lot to unpack.

## I. The first randomized trials show moderation, not abstinence

The most revealing clinical data comes from two directions. First, [Hendershot et al. published the first Phase 2 RCT of semaglutide for alcohol use disorder](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39937469/) in JAMA Psychiatry in February 2025. In 48 non-treatment-seeking adults, even at low doses (maxing at 1.0 mg per week, well below the 2.4 mg used for weight management), semaglutide produced medium-to-large effect sizes: alcohol consumption β = −0.48 (p = .01), weekly craving β = −0.39 (p = .01), and drinks per drinking day β = −0.41 (p = .04). Some of these effect sizes exceeded those typically seen with naltrexone, the current standard pharmacotherapy. A reasonable criticism, raised in [online discussions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46945448), is that 9 weeks at sub-therapeutic doses with 48 participants is too short and too small to draw firm conclusions. But the counterargument is also reasonable: seeing any measurable effect at these doses and this duration is itself noteworthy.

Second, Joseph Schacht's randomized trial at the University of Colorado Anschutz, reported in the Khullar piece, found that in roughly 50 participants drinking about 7 drinks per day, those on semaglutide cut their consumption by half over two months. Heavy drinking days fell from about two-thirds to one-quarter. But here is the part I find most interesting: the drug did not make people more likely to stop drinking entirely. It induced moderation. {{< img src="glp1-moderation-not-abstinence1.png" alt="Bar chart showing Schacht trial results: semaglutide halved daily alcohol consumption from approximately 7 drinks to 3.5 drinks per day, and reduced heavy drinking days from 66% to 25%, demonstrating moderation rather than abstinence" width="80%" >}} If this finding holds, it represents a genuinely different therapeutic model. Most existing addiction interventions are built around the goal of abstinence. A drug that reliably turns heavy drinkers into moderate ones would be something structurally new. Schacht calls it a potential "Prozac moment" for alcohol-use disorder, and I think the analogy is apt in both its promise and its warning: Prozac transformed treatment of depression, but its reputation as a miracle drug outpaced the nuance of its actual efficacy, and the chemical imbalance narrative it popularized later proved incomplete.

## II. The Swedish registry study is the most striking result to date

While randomized trials have been small and short, one observational study provides a view at genuine scale. [Lähteenvuo et al. published in JAMA Psychiatry](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39535805/) in November 2024 a Swedish nationwide registry analysis of 227,868 individuals with alcohol use disorder, tracked over a median of 8.8 years. The within-individual design — comparing the same person during periods on and off GLP-1 medications — controls for many of the confounders that typically plague observational research. Semaglutide use was associated with a 36% reduction in AUD-related hospitalization (aHR 0.64) and a 32% reduction in any substance use disorder hospitalization. Liraglutide showed similar but slightly smaller effects.

Perhaps the most notable finding is what happened with the comparison group. In the same analysis, using the same within-individual methodology, the three FDA-approved AUD medications (disulfiram, acamprosate, and naltrexone) showed no statistically significant reduction in hospitalization risk. {{< img src="glp1-vs-standard-aud-meds1.png" alt="Forest-plot-style chart comparing adjusted hazard ratios for AUD hospitalization: semaglutide at 0.64 and liraglutide at 0.72 both showing significant reduction, while disulfiram, acamprosate, and naltrexone all showed no statistically significant effect in the same within-individual Swedish registry analysis" width="80%" >}} This is observational, not causal. There are real confounders: people prescribed GLP-1s likely had comorbid diabetes or obesity, potentially different healthcare engagement, and different baseline characteristics. But the sheer scale of the sample and the within-individual design make it difficult to wave away entirely. An [earlier Danish registry study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36031011/) found a similar direction: GLP-1 receptor agonist users had fewer alcohol-related hospital contacts than DPP-IV inhibitor users (HR 0.46 in the first three months), though that effect did not persist at longer durations.

## III. The opioid evidence is early but mechanistically compelling

The opioid story sits at a different point on the evidence curve. Patricia (Sue) Grigson at Penn State has demonstrated in [preclinical work](https://www.statnews.com/2024/02/17/opioid-cravings-glp1-weight-loss-liraglutide-penn-state/) that liraglutide reduces fentanyl-seeking behavior in addicted rats and, crucially, suppresses activity in the locus coeruleus, a brainstem region that drives the acute misery of opioid withdrawal. This dual action — reducing the reward of the drug *and* reducing the pain of not having it — is mechanistically interesting because it maps onto the distinction that Kent Berridge, the University of Michigan neuroscientist, has developed between "wanting" and "liking." GLP-1 receptor agonists appear to limit dopamine spikes (the wanting) without reducing baseline dopamine levels (the liking). In animal studies, mice on GLP-1s given cocaine experience smaller surges of dopamine than control mice but otherwise maintain normal neurotransmitter levels. The drugs may calm the water without draining the pool.

Grigson's colleague Sarah Kawasaki ran a small human trial: [20 patients with opioid use disorder at a residential treatment center](https://www.statnews.com/2024/02/17/opioid-cravings-glp1-weight-loss-liraglutide-penn-state/) received either liraglutide or placebo. The liraglutide group reported 40% fewer cravings over three weeks, with significance emerging by day 10 in patients also on buprenorphine. Only 9 of 20 participants completed the study, and the controlled residential setting is very different from real-world conditions. But a larger trial combining semaglutide with methadone or buprenorphine is now underway, and Kawasaki makes a point that I think is underappreciated: we routinely treat hypertension with three or four medications simultaneously, adding drugs until the condition is under control. We have never had that option with addiction, and it has been profoundly limiting.

## IV. The evidence landscape is broad but thin

A [comprehensive IUPHAR review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39032839/) published in 2024 catalogs preclinical evidence spanning alcohol, opioids, nicotine, cocaine, and amphetamines. The [Klausen et al. review in the British Journal of Pharmacology](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8820218/) maps GLP-1 receptor expression across the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, and other reward regions. The mechanistic story is increasingly coherent. But an earlier trial of single-dose exenatide for [cocaine use disorder](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8517504/) found no effect, likely because acute dosing did not replicate the chronic exposure that works in animal models. Not every GLP-1 application succeeds, and the negative results matter for calibrating expectations. {{< img src="glp1-addiction-evidence-landscape1.png" alt="Evidence landscape table showing key GLP-1 addiction studies from 2021 to 2025, including study type, drug, target substance, sample size, and headline finding, with the Lähteenvuo Swedish registry study and Hendershot Phase 2 RCT highlighted as the most significant recent results" width="80%" >}}

## V. The open questions are real

There are several things that should temper enthusiasm.

**Durability.** Clinical trials have observed patients for weeks or months. Addiction is a chronic disease that can last a lifetime. Some of Grigson's rats developed tolerance to GLP-1s: after several weeks on a dose, drug-seeking behavior returned. Randy Seeley, the director of the Michigan Nutrition Obesity Research Center, worries that the anti-addiction effects are "spillover" from the weight-loss mechanism and will fade once patients plateau — a view that is plausible and not yet refuted by data.

**Anhedonia.** A small minority of GLP-1 users report a flattening of pleasure and motivation that goes beyond reduced cravings. The European Medicines Agency investigated reports of suicidal thoughts and concluded there was no causal link. The FDA in January 2026 [requested that suicide warnings be removed](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03911-x) from GLP-1 labels, though it noted it could not entirely rule out a small risk. Observational studies on mental health effects point in contradictory directions: one Nature network analysis suggested GLP-1s reduce suicidal ideation risk by more than half, while another found they more than doubled the risk of suicidal behavior. The data remain frustratingly ambiguous.

**The "why" problem.** GLP-1s do nothing to address the underlying causes of addiction: trauma, loneliness, pain, poverty. They may quiet cravings and even ruminations, but they are not a substitute for mental-health care. This is not a reason to dismiss them, but it is a reason not to frame them as a cure.

**Off-label reality.** The off-label use is already happening. People are discovering these effects through [online communities](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46945448), and the anecdotal reports track remarkably well with the clinical findings. Multiple people describe their relationship with alcohol shifting from compulsive to indifferent. One person who previously drank five IPAs nightly now has one every few months. Another can predict exactly when his dose wears off based on when beer cravings return. The pattern is consistent: reduced wanting, intact liking. But this is moving faster than the evidence can support, and the gap between anecdote and validated treatment protocol is where harm can occur.

## Where this stands

For a field where new addiction treatments have been approved at a rate of roughly one every 25 years, the convergence of preclinical data, multiple randomized trials, large-scale registry evidence, and a flood of consistent anecdotal reports all pointing in the same direction is unusual. It is not yet definitive. No Phase 3 trial has been completed. The longest RCT lasted 9 weeks. No one knows whether the effects survive weight plateau or what happens after discontinuation. But the direction of travel is clear enough to watch closely. The next two to three years of trial results will determine whether GLP-1 receptor agonists become a genuine addition to the addiction medicine toolkit or another case where early excitement outran durable evidence.
