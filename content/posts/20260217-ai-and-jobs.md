faq:
- question: "Will AI create more jobs than it destroys?"
  answer: "History suggests yes. Goldman Sachs research based on Autor, Chin, Salomons, and Seegmiller shows over 60% of current US employment is in occupations that did not exist in 1940. SVB data confirms the pattern across every major platform shift: internet and email, smartphones, and e-commerce each displaced one set of tasks while creating demand for new ones. The AI transition appears to follow the same pattern, with $650 billion in hyperscaler capex and a 24% increase in San Francisco startup formation signaling where new jobs are forming."
- question: "How many customer support jobs has AI replaced?"
  answer: "According to Pave Data Lab, customer support's share of new hires fell from 8.3% in Q4 2023 to 2.88% in Q3 2025, a 65% decline in eight quarters across 386,500 tracked new hires. The steepest single drop occurred between Q2 and Q3 2025, when the share fell from 5.81% to 2.88%. This makes customer support one of the first white-collar categories to show measurable AI job displacement in real-time hiring data."
- question: "How much are hyperscalers spending on AI infrastructure in 2026?"
  answer: "Combined capital expenditure guidance from Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Oracle approaches $650 billion in 2026, roughly triple the $220 billion spent in 2024. Amazon leads at approximately $38 billion per quarter (up 42% YoY), followed by Microsoft at $30 billion (up 89% YoY). This AI infrastructure buildout creates downstream labor demand in data center construction, power generation, chip design, and the AI application layer."
- question: "What percentage of today's jobs didn't exist in 1940?"
  answer: "Over 60%, according to Goldman Sachs research citing Autor, Chin, Salomons, and Seegmiller. The largest expansion is in 'Professionals' and 'Managers,' categories that barely existed as formal occupations before the postwar knowledge economy. This research suggests technology generates entirely new categories of economic activity that absorb more labor than the categories it compresses."
- question: "Why is San Francisco the only tech hub with growing startup formation?"
  answer: "According to SVB's State of Market 1H 2026 report, San Francisco is the only major US tech hub where VC-backed company formation has grown since 2022, up 24%. Every other hub has contracted, with Los Angeles down 48%, Atlanta down 47%, and Miami down 34%. Carta's State of Startups 2025 confirms the Bay Area captured 40.3% of all early-stage venture capital and 50.6% of AI-specific funding, driven by AI-native startups clustering around infrastructure and talent."
- question: "Is AI permanently eliminating customer service jobs?"
  answer: "The data points to displacement of specific tasks, not wholesale elimination. Pave Data Lab shows a 65% decline in customer support's share of new hires between Q4 2023 and Q3 2025. But historical precedent from SVB and Goldman Sachs data shows every prior platform shift (internet, smartphones, e-commerce) displaced one category of work while creating new categories elsewhere. The question is whether the new roles emerge fast enough to absorb displaced workers."

Customer support's share of new hires just fell off a cliff: from **8.3%** to **2.88%** in eight quarters, according to [Pave Data Lab](https://www.pave.com/data-lab). That's a **65%** decline. The steepest single drop happened between Q2 and Q3 2025, when the number cratered. This is AI job displacement measured not in forecasts or projections, but in actual hiring data.

[a16z's latest Charts of the Week](https://a16z.com/charts-of-the-week-customer-service-reckoning/) led with this number under the header "Customer Service Reckoning." The framing is deliberate. It's the most visceral evidence yet that AI agents are eating white-collar tasks in real time, not in some forecaster's projection, but in actual hiring data across 386,500 tracked new hires. The curve doesn't flatten. It accelerates.

But here's what caught my eye: the same newsletter that ran the hiring collapse chart also ran the charts that explain why it might not matter the way you think it does.

## Does technology create more jobs than it destroys?

a16z included an SVB State of Market chart that maps employment shifts across three prior platform transitions: internet and email, smartphone apps, and e-commerce. In each case, the pattern is identical. A technology displaces one set of tasks while creating demand for a different set. Economists call this occupational churn. It looks like creative destruction in a spreadsheet.

{{< img src="new-tech-replaces-tasks.png" alt="SVB State of Market chart showing technology job creation across three platform shifts: internet shrank office admin from 22.9M to 18.2M while business operations grew from 4.6M to 10.4M, smartphones compressed bookkeepers while software developers grew 9x, e-commerce eroded retail sales while packers and order fillers expanded" width="90%" >}}

Internet and email shrank office administration from **22.9 million** to **18.2 million** workers. Business operations grew from **4.6 million** to **10.4 million** over the same period. Smartphone apps compressed bookkeepers, travel agents, and bank tellers while software developers grew from **1.2 million** to **10.4 million**, a 9x increase. E-commerce eroded retail sales positions while packers and order fillers expanded.

The displaced occupations and the new ones don't overlap. The people who lost travel agent jobs didn't become software developers. But the economy that shrank travel agencies also built Uber, DoorDash, and the entire app ecosystem that now employs millions. The transitions are messy, uneven, and often cruel to individuals. The aggregate net job creation numbers still go up.

A second chart in the same newsletter, sourced from Goldman Sachs and based on Autor, Chin, Salomons, and Seegmiller's research, stretches this logic back to 1940. The finding: over **60%** of current U.S. employment is in occupations that did not exist in 1940. Not variations on old jobs. Entirely new categories that nobody could have described, let alone trained for, at the time.

{{< img src="technology-creates-jobs.png" alt="Goldman Sachs chart based on Autor research showing over 60% of current US employment in occupations that did not exist in 1940, with the largest expansion in professionals and managers, illustrating how technology creates new job categories across every major economic cycle since World War II" width="90%" >}}

The concentration is telling. The biggest expansion is in "Professionals" and "Managers," categories that barely existed as formal occupations before the postwar knowledge economy created them. That's not augmentation filling in around the edges. That's technology generating entirely new categories of economic activity that absorb more labor than the categories it compressed.

## Where the $650 billion in AI infrastructure goes

The historical pattern is reassuring in the abstract. But it doesn't tell you when or where the new jobs show up. For that, you need to follow the capital expenditure cycle.

{{< img src="hyperscaler-capex.png" alt="Hyperscaler AI capex 2026 chart showing combined capital expenditure for Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Oracle rising from roughly $70 billion in 2018 to over $650 billion in 2026, a near tripling in just two years driven by AI infrastructure buildout" width="90%" >}}

Combined capex guidance from the five major hyperscalers (Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Oracle) approaches **$650 billion** for 2026, according to Bloomberg estimates. That's roughly triple the **$220 billion** they spent in 2024. Amazon alone is running at **$38 billion** per quarter, up 42% year over year. Microsoft increased 89%. Alphabet 95%.

I [wrote recently](https://philippdubach.com/posts/the-saaspocalypse-paradox/) about the paradox embedded in these numbers: the market is simultaneously punishing hyperscalers for spending too much on AI while punishing software companies for being too exposed to AI. Both can't hold. If AI is displacing white-collar work at the rate the Pave data suggests, then the infrastructure investment is generating returns. If it isn't generating returns, the displacement isn't happening at scale. The capex figure doesn't tell you which interpretation is correct, but it tells you what the builders believe.

$650 billion is not a hedge. It's a conviction bet. That level of capital deployment, sustained over multiple years, creates its own labor demand in data center construction, power generation, chip design, networking, and the entire AI application layer that sits on top of the infrastructure. Enrico Moretti's research on [employment multipliers](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~moretti/text.pdf) suggests each high-tech job creates roughly five additional service-sector jobs in the same metro. If even a fraction of the AI infrastructure buildout translates into permanent technical employment, the downstream effects on local labor markets are substantial.

## Where the new AI jobs are forming

The most underrated chart in the a16z newsletter is the one about company formation. SVB's State of Market report for 1H 2026 shows venture-backed startup formation rates by metro since 2022. Every major U.S. tech hub has contracted. Los Angeles is down **48%**. Atlanta is down **47%**. Miami, Chicago, D.C., Seattle: all down between 23% and 34%.

One city is up. San Francisco: **+24%**.

{{< img src="sf-company-formation.png" alt="SVB State of Market 2026 chart showing VC-backed company formation rates for 11 US tech hubs, with San Francisco the only city showing growth at plus 24% since 2022 while all others declined, illustrating AI startup concentration in the Bay Area" width="90%" >}}

The rest of the country is in a venture drawdown. San Francisco is in a boom. This isn't a coincidence and it isn't about vibes. Carta's State of Startups 2025 data (also in the a16z package) confirms the Bay Area captured **40.3%** of all early-stage venture capital, including **50.6%** in AI specifically. The startups being formed in SF right now are disproportionately AI-native companies, the ones that will build the products and services on top of the $650 billion in infrastructure the hyperscalers are deploying.

This is where the Pave customer support data and the company formation data connect. The jobs that are disappearing (tier-1 support, basic back-office workflows, knowledge work automation targets) and the jobs that are forming (AI application companies in SF, infrastructure roles across the capex buildout) aren't the same jobs. They don't require the same skills, they don't pay the same wages, and they don't exist in the same cities. The pattern from the SVB historical data is repeating: technology displaces tasks in one category and creates entirely new categories of work elsewhere.

The question I can't answer, and I'm not sure anyone can, is whether the "elsewhere" absorbs enough people fast enough. The internet transition took roughly 15 years to net out positively in aggregate employment. The smartphone transition was faster. AI job displacement has the steepest curve yet, with customer support hiring falling **65%** in two years, not fifteen. The infrastructure investment is enormous, the historical pattern is consistent, and the geographic concentration of new company formation is real. But there is nothing in the data that guarantees the second act of this workforce transformation arrives on the same schedule as the first.

Have feedback, comments, or ideas? I'd love to hear from you.
