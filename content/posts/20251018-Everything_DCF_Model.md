  "Mauboussin's core claim: every valuation of a cash-generating asset is implicitly a DCF model, whether the investor builds one explicitly or not.",
  "The framework draws a clean line between investors (who price future cash flows) and speculators (who buy in anticipation of price increases without reference to value).",
  "DCF does not apply to gold, art, or crypto because these assets produce no cash flows, meaning their prices are set purely by supply and demand.",

faq = [
  {question = "What does 'everything is a DCF model' mean?", answer = "The phrase, coined by Michael Mauboussin and Dan Callahan at Morgan Stanley, means that whenever investors value a stake in any cash-generating asset, whether stocks, bonds, or real estate, they are implicitly using a discounted cash flow model. The value of any such asset is the present value of the cash it can distribute to its owners."},
  {question = "Can DCF models be used to value assets beyond stocks?", answer = "Yes. DCF analysis applies to any asset that generates cash flows, including corporate bonds, real estate, private equity holdings, and entire businesses. The core principle is the same: estimate future cash flows and discount them to present value using a rate that reflects risk and the time value of money."},
  {question = "What is the difference between an investor and a speculator according to this framework?", answer = "An investor buys an asset based on the present value of its expected future cash flows, which is a DCF mindset. A speculator buys an asset in anticipation that its price will go up without reference to its underlying value. Mauboussin notes that the behavior of most market participants is a blend of the two."},
  {question = "What are common mistakes when building a DCF model?", answer = "According to Mauboussin, the most frequent errors include using too short an explicit forecast period, failing to link capital investment to growth assumptions, using a faulty risk-free rate, and assuming unrealistic growth rates in terminal value calculations. Many models also ignore the tendency for returns on invested capital to revert toward the mean over time."},
  {question = "Does DCF work for assets that don't produce cash flows?", answer = "No. Mauboussin is clear that the DCF framework does not apply to assets that do not generate cash flows, such as gold, art, wine, or cryptocurrencies. Those assets are priced purely by supply and demand rather than by the present value of future distributions."},

A brilliant piece of writing from [Michael Mauboussin](https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/individual-investor/about-us/people-and-teams/investment-professionals/michael-mauboussin.html) and [Dan Callahan](https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/individual-investor/about-us/people-and-teams/investment-professionals/dan-callahan.html) at Morgan Stanley that was formative in what I personally believe when it comes to valuation. 

> […] we want to suggest the mantra "everything is a DCF model." The point is that whenever investors value a stake in a cash-generating asset, they should recognize that they are using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. […] The value of those businesses is the present value of the cash they can distribute to their owners. This suggests a mindset that is very different from that of a speculator, who buys a stock in anticipation that it will go up without reference to its value. Investors and speculators have always coexisted in markets, and the behavior of many market participants is a blend of the two.
