(1) A new academic paper suggests the rise of passive investing may be fueling fragile market moves.
(2) According to a study to be published in the American Economic Review, evidence is building that active managers are slow to scoop up stocks en masse when prices move away from their intrinsic worth.
(3) Thanks to this lethargic trading behavior and the relentless boom in benchmark-tracking index funds, the impact of each trade on prices gets amplified, explaining how sell orders can induce broader equity gyrations

Passive investing, the supposedly boring strategy of buying and holding index funds, might actually be making markets more volatile. A new study set to be published in the American Economic Review finds that active managers are slow to scoop up stocks when prices move away from their intrinsic worth. Meanwhile, the relentless boom in benchmark-tracking index funds means that each trade gets amplified, explaining how sell orders can induce broader equity gyrations.
Justina Lee for Bloomberg writes that this week's AI-fueled market swings perfectly illustrate the phenomenon. Big equity gauges plunged on Monday over fears about an AI model, before swiftly rebounding.

The researchers from UCLA, Stockholm School of Economics, and University of Minnesota have identified what they call "Big Passive"—a financial landscape that's proving less dynamic and more volatile. When most investors are on autopilot, the few remaining active traders have disproportionate influence.
This doesn't invalidate passive investing's core benefits—lower costs and better long-term returns for most investors remain compelling. But it does suggest that our increasingly passive financial system has some unintended consequences.
