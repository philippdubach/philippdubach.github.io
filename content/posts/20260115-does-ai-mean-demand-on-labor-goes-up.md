question = "What is the AI productivity paradox?"
answer = "The AI productivity paradox describes how tools that make individual tasks faster often increase total workload rather than freeing up time. Research shows 77% of employees say AI tools have added to their workload, and workers in AI-exposed occupations now work roughly 3 extra hours per week while leisure time has dropped by the same amount."

[[faq]]
question = "How does the Jevons paradox apply to AI?"
answer = "The Jevons paradox, observed in 1865 when more efficient steam engines increased coal consumption rather than reducing it, applies to AI in that efficiency expands what we're expected to do. When you can build an app in a weekend that used to take months, you don't build one—you build six. The friction that once protected us from infinite expectations evaporates."

[[faq]]
question = "Why didn't AI give us the shorter work week economists predicted?"
answer = "Keynes predicted a 15-hour work week by now, and we got the productivity gains he anticipated—yet we work longer hours than ever. Only 21% of employees use time saved by AI for personal life; the rest reinvest it into work. When capability expands, so does the definition of \"enough,\" and the bar rises accordingly."

[[faq]]
question = "What is Parkinson's Law for AI?"
answer = "Parkinson's Law states that work expands to fill the time available. The AI corollary is that work expands to fill capabilities available. More capability means more possibility—and more obligation. In competitive environments, someone who uses that expanded capability while you rest will outrun you."

[Joe Weisenthal](https://x.com/TheStalwart/status/2011418760813629738) from Bloomberg, this week:

>All my shower thoughts now are about designing efficient workflows for synthesizing, collecting, labeling and annotating data.

Same. Since I started building every app and tool I thought would make my life easier, my workflow more efficient, I haven't stopped. Apparently [non-developers are now writing apps](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/the-rise-of-micro-apps-non-developers-are-writing-apps-instead-of-buying-them/) instead of buying them. This is the AI productivity paradox in miniature: the tools get better and we do more, not less.

The assumed narrative is still AI displaces jobs, humans collect UBI, society figures out leisure. But the trajectory might be more work, not less. A [recent NBER study](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/ais-power-grows-so-does-our-workday) found that workers in AI-exposed occupations now work roughly 3 extra hours per week—and leisure time has dropped by the same amount. [Upwork's research](https://investors.upwork.com/news-releases/news-release-details/upwork-study-finds-employee-workloads-rising-despite-increased-c) puts it bluntly: 77% of employees say AI tools have *added* to their workload.

The [Jevons paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) is 160 years old: when James Watt made steam engines more efficient, coal consumption didn't fall. It exploded. Efficiency made coal useful in new ways. Satya Nadella [referenced this for AI](https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2025/02/04/g-s1-46018/ai-deepseek-economics-jevons-paradox) after DeepSeek rattled the markets. Erik Brynjolfsson argues it applies to AI-augmented occupations—coders, radiologists, translators. Make something more efficient and you find more things to do with it.

When I can build an app in a weekend that used to take months, I don't build one. I build six. When I can write a report in an hour, I write five. The friction that once protected us from infinite expectations evaporates. This is the Jevons paradox applied not just to markets or coal, but to our own time and cognitive capacity—a kind of psychological rebound effect where internal expectations outrun what's actually sustainable.

Keynes predicted a [15-hour work week](http://www.econ.yale.edu/smith/econ116a/keynes1.pdf) by now. We got the productivity gains. We work longer hours than ever. Only [21% of employees](https://hellofuture.orange.com/en/the-ai-productivity-paradox-the-new-tech-may-be-eating-into-your-leisure-time/) actually use the time AI saves them for personal life. The rest reinvest it right back into work. When capability expands, so does the definition of "enough." The bar rises.

If AI makes me 10x more productive, that's not 10x more free time. That's 10x more I *could* be doing. In a competitive environment—founding, climbing, anything with stakes—someone who uses that 10x while I rest will outrun me. The fear was displacement. The reality might be inescapability.

[Parkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law#First_meaning): work expands to fill time available. The AI corollary: work expands to fill capabilities available. More capability means more possibility—and more obligation. We should know where this points.
