faq:
- question: What are the key findings of the State of AI Report 2025?
  answer: 'The report covers reasoning models from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and DeepSeek capable of planning and self-correction; China establishing itself as a credible #2 in global AI capability; 44% of US businesses now paying for AI tools (up from 5% in 2023); and multi-gigawatt data centers backed by sovereign funds where power supply has become as critical as GPUs.'
- question: Who made the State of AI Report 2025 and is it biased?
  answer: 'The report was created by Nathan Benaich, founder of Air Street Capital, a venture capital firm that invests in AI-first companies. The report is based on an open survey of 1,200 AI practitioners, which introduces selection bias since participation is voluntary and skews toward people already engaged with AI.'
- question: Is the claim that 95% of professionals use AI accurate?
  answer: 'The 95% figure comes from a self-selected survey of 1,200 AI practitioners, not a representative sample of all professionals. While the sample size is statistically significant for a national poll, the main concern is selection bias from voluntary participation, which likely inflates the adoption figure well beyond the general professional population.'
- question: How has China's AI capability changed according to the report?
  answer: 'According to the State of AI Report 2025, China''s AI systems closed the gap with Western competitors to establish the country as a credible #2 in global AI capability. This was driven by companies like DeepSeek releasing reasoning models that match top Western models at lower computational cost.'
- question: What does the report say about AI business adoption and spending?
  answer: 'The report found that 44% of US businesses now pay for AI tools, up from just 5% in 2023, with average contracts reaching $530,000. These figures should be considered alongside the report''s methodology, as the survey population of AI practitioners may not represent broader enterprise spending patterns.'

This year's rendition of [The State of AI Report](https://www.stateof.ai) is making rounds on LinkedIn (yes, LinkedIn the place where the great [E = MC2 + AI](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fy9dk1prvwf2b1.jpg) equation was "discovered").

Worth keeping in mind this is made by [Nathan Benaich](https://www.nathanbenaich.com) the Founder of Air Street Capital, a venture capital firm investing in "AI-first companies", so obviously comes with a lot of bias. It's also a relatively small, open survey, with 1'200 "AI practitioners" surveyed.
An example of the bias:
> shows that 95% of professionals now use AI at work or home

It's obvious that 95% of professionals don't use AI at work or home, and these results are heavily skewed. Nevertheless, the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xiLl0VdrlNMAei8pmaX4ojIOfej6lhvZbOIK7Z6C-Go/edit?usp=sharing) has a nice comprehensive review of research headlines over the year:

- OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and DeepSeek all releasing reasoning models capable of planning, verification, and self-correction.
- China's AI systems closed the gap to establish the country as a credible #2 in global AI capability.
- 44% of U.S. businesses now paying for AI tools (up from just 5% in 2023), average contracts reaching $530'000, and 95% of surveyed professionals using AI regularly—while the capability-to-price ratio doubles every 6-8 months.
- Multi-gigawatt data centers backed by sovereign funds compete globally, with power supply and land becoming as critical as GPUs.

_(13/10/2025) Update: I was just reminded that a sample size of 1'200 is highly statistically significant, even for a national-level poll. The main concern here, however, remains, which is potential selection bias, likely stemming from the fact that participation is driven by people who want to take the survey. It's unclear how much this bias affects the results, but purely in terms of sample size, it is more than sufficient._
