Wargaming is a peculiar discipline. [Serious people sit around tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame#/media/File:MCWC-wargame-Lacey-13-cropped.png) covered with 2,500 counters, roll dice, consult combat results tables, and watch simulated catastrophe unfold across a five-by-six-foot map. The Center for Strategic and International Studies has been doing exactly this for Taiwan, running over 70 iterations of conflict scenarios across three studies. What do 70 simulated wars teach us?

The [first major study](https://www.csis.org/analysis/first-battle-next-war-wargaming-chinese-invasion-taiwan), published in January 2023, modeled a Chinese amphibious invasion. They ran it 24 times. In most scenarios, the US, Taiwan, and Japan defeated the invasion. That sounds reassuring until you read the casualty projections: dozens of ships lost, hundreds of aircraft destroyed, tens of thousands of servicemembers killed or wounded. Ninety percent of aircraft losses occurred on the ground from missile strikes before planes could even take off. The US global inventory of long-range anti-ship missiles, roughly 450 at the time, was exhausted within seven days. The report's authors titled their conclusion "Victory Is Not Enough."

Taiwan would survive in the simulations, but with its economy devastated and basic services collapsed. China would suffer comparably. The costs on all sides were high enough that the authors explicitly warned against a "pyrrhic victory" that would damage America's global position for years. There were no clean outcomes.

The [second study](https://www.csis.org/analysis/lights-out-wargaming-chinese-blockade-taiwan), published in July 2025, examined a different scenario: a blockade rather than an invasion. Perhaps, the thinking goes, Beijing might prefer something less dramatic. The wargamers ran 26 iterations. The results were, if anything, more troubling.

Almost all scenarios produced casualties in the thousands, even at lower escalation levels. More concerning was a pattern the researchers observed in free-play games where participants could choose their responses without constraints. Despite reluctance to escalate, teams responded to perceived provocations with minor escalations of their own. Two of five free-play games spiraled into general war, with missiles striking the Chinese mainland and Guam. The authors wrote: "Any blockade creates escalatory pressures that are difficult to contain."

The energy numbers are particularly stark. Taiwan's liquefied natural gas reserves would run out in roughly 10 days. Coal lasts about seven weeks. Oil, around 20 weeks. A blockade does not need to achieve military victory to succeed; it only needs to strangle supply lines long enough.

Reading these reports from Switzerland, I find myself struck by a structural observation. Both sides appear to believe they can manage escalation. The wargames suggest otherwise. Escalation has its own logic, driven by immediate tactical pressures that override strategic intentions. In game after game, small provocations compounded.

The [recent exercises](https://thediplomat.com/2026/01/chinas-taiwan-drills-are-crossing-a-new-line/) only sharpen the picture. "Justice Mission 2025," conducted on December 29 and 30, involved 130 PLA aircraft, 14 navy ships, and eight coast guard vessels. Ninety aircraft crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, the largest such incursion since August 2022. The exercise pattern closely resembles the blockade scenarios modeled in the wargames: coast guard vessels for boarding, naval assets for interdiction, aircraft for area control.

Meanwhile, Chinese researchers published a [simulation](https://www.tomshardware.com/networking/china-simulated-a-starlink-blockade-over-taiwan-ccp-scientists-say-around-1-000-drones-would-be-enough-to-cut-satellite-internet-to-the-island) suggesting approximately 2,000 drones could create an electromagnetic shield to block Starlink communications over Taiwan. Information warfare is now part of the operational picture.

And Taiwan itself? Its opposition party has blocked the asymmetric defense budget for the sixth time this month. The very "porcupine strategy" that wargames identify as essential to survival remains politically contested on the island.

The gap between tabletop simulations and actual military exercises is narrowing. But the wargames model military operations, not economics. The monetary implications may be equally consequential.

When Western nations froze Russian reserves in 2022, they demonstrated that dollar-denominated assets carry confiscation risk. I've [written about this before](/posts/pozsars-bretton-woods-iii-the-framework-1/2/): Zoltan Pozsar's Bretton Woods III framework describes a shift from Treasury-backed reserves toward commodities and other "outside money." The Russia sanctions pushed that shift forward. A Taiwan conflict would push it into overdrive.

China holds roughly $760 billion in US Treasuries, down from peaks above $1.3 trillion. Beijing has been diversifying for years. But the real economic shock would not be reserve freezes; it would be semiconductors. Taiwan produces over 90% of the world's most advanced chips. TSMC's fabrication plants sit directly in the conflict zone. Any serious disruption would cascade through every industry that depends on computing, which is to say, all of them.

The new US administration's policy signals remain mixed. Trade tensions have intensified, yet explicit security commitments remain ambiguous. For central banks watching from the sidelines, the lesson compounds: physical assets and commodity reserves look increasingly attractive relative to financial claims that can be frozen or devalued. [Three years into this framework](/posts/pozsars-bretton-woods-iii-three-years-later-2/2/), gold has roughly doubled while foreign central bank Treasury holdings have declined. The trend predates Taiwan tensions, but a conflict would supercharge it.

The CSIS researchers note that wargames do not predict; they illuminate structure. The structure they illuminate here is sobering. High costs for everyone, escalation pressures that resist containment, no clean exits. The invasion scenarios produce "victory" that damages the victor. The blockade scenarios produce conflicts that spiral beyond initial intentions.

"The unexpected can happen," the authors write in their closing observations. "Preparation is vital." But what does preparation even mean when every option comes with catastrophic costs? The wargames offer no answer, only the structure of the problem itself. Perhaps that is the most useful thing a simulation can provide: not prediction, but clarity about what we are choosing between.
