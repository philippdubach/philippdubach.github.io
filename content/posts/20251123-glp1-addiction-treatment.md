faq:
- question: Does semaglutide reduce alcohol consumption?
  answer: A phase 2 randomized controlled trial published in February 2025 found that low-dose semaglutide reduced alcohol craving, drinks per drinking day, and heavy drinking episodes compared to placebo. Effect sizes for some outcomes exceeded those typically seen with naltrexone, one of the few FDA-approved medications for alcohol use disorder.
- question: How does semaglutide compare to naltrexone for alcohol use disorder?
  answer: The February 2025 UNC trial showed that despite using doses lower than standard weight loss dosing, semaglutide produced effect sizes exceeding those typically seen with naltrexone. Real-world data also found semaglutide associated with significantly lower risk of AUD diagnosis compared to naltrexone. However, naltrexone remains FDA-approved for AUD while semaglutide is not yet approved for this indication.
- question: Why are there so few medications approved for alcohol use disorder?
  answer: New therapies for alcohol use disorder have been approved at a rate of roughly one every 25 years. Only three medications (naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram) are currently FDA-approved. This limited pharmacotherapy landscape makes the early GLP-1 research particularly significant for the millions of people with AUD who have few effective treatment options.
- question: Are GLP-1 drugs approved for treating alcohol addiction?
  answer: No. GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide are currently FDA-approved only for type 2 diabetes, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea. While early trial results are promising, larger clinical trials are needed before GLP-1 drugs could be approved as an addiction treatment. Phase 3 trials are underway.

> Alcohol and other substance use disorders (ASUDs) are complex, multifaceted, but treatable medical conditions with widespread medical, psychological, and societal consequences. However, treatment options remain limited, therefore the discovery and development of new treatments for ASUDs is critical. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), currently approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea, have recently emerged as potential new pharmacotherapies for ASUDs.

This development matters most for people struggling with substance use disorders who have few effective treatment options. It also matters for manufacturers like Novo Nordisk facing [patent expiration pressures on Ozempic](https://philippdubach.com/posts/novo-nordisks-post-patent-strategy/). The research into GLP-1RAs for addiction treatment is early but notable given the limited pharmacotherapy options currently available for ASUDs. In February 2025, researchers at UNC published results from the first randomized controlled trial of semaglutide for ASUD treatment. The phase 2 trial enrolled 48 non-treatment-seeking adults with AUD and administered low-dose semaglutide [(0.25 mg/week for 4 weeks, 0.5 mg/week for 4 weeks - standard dosing for weight loss reaches 2.4 mg per week)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2829811) over 9 weeks. Participants on semaglutide consumed less alcohol in controlled laboratory settings and reported fewer drinks per drinking day in their normal lives. They also reported less craving for alcohol. Heavy drinking episodes declined more sharply in the semaglutide group compared to placebo over the nine-week trial. Despite the low doses, effect sizes for some drinking outcomes exceeded those typically seen with naltrexone, one of the few FDA-approved medications for alcohol use disorder. While larger trials are needed to confirm these results, the early evidence suggests GLP-1 may offer a meaningful treatment option for a condition where new therapies have been approved at a rate of roughly one every 25 years.
