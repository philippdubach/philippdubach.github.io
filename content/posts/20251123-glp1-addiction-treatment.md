> Alcohol and other substance use disorders (ASUDs) are complex, multifaceted, but treatable medical conditions with widespread medical, psychological, and societal consequences. However, treatment options remain limited, therefore the discovery and development of new treatments for ASUDs is critical. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), currently approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea, have recently emerged as potential new pharmacotherapies for ASUDs. Following an overview of the epidemiology, biology, consequences, and treatments of ASUDs, this review provides a summary of the emerging role of GLP-1RAs in the treatment of ASUDs by elucidating their interactions with various neurobiological pathways involved in addiction. We also highlight existing gaps in research, future directions, and broader implications related to the potential use of GLP-1RAs for addiction treatment.

This is not only good news for Novo Nordisk struggling with Ozempic Sales but people struggling with ASUDs
