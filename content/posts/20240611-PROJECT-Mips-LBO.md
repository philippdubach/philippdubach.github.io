A bit of a different project this time - I came across something me and a group of fellow students built that gained us a top spot at the GMA Challenge hosted by Cambridge Judge Business School:


>The Global Mergers & Acquisitions Challenge stands as the world's largest M&A case competition, drawing students from over 120 universities. Sponsored by Blackstone, CVC Capital Partners, Partners Group, and Verdier & Co and organised by the University of Cambridge, it serves as an international stage for students to showcase their M&A strategies.


Based on Case Study competition
