• **Traditional wisdom still applies, but with caveats**: For 30+ years, investing in low-cost US equity index funds (like S&P 500) has been the best strategy for most people—better than active trading or paying financial advisors who take percentage fees that compound negatively over time. These funds automatically weight investments by company market capitalization and require minimal effort or expertise.

• **The S&P 500 has become dangerously concentrated**: The top 10 companies now represent approximately 38% of the S&P 500's value (a historic concentration level), with Nvidia alone accounting for 7%. This means what was once a diversified investment across 500 companies is now heavily weighted toward a small number of tech giants, many of which are betting heavily on AI.

• **Concerns about AI speculation and valuations**: The creator views the current AI boom as potentially speculative or bubble-like, with many top S&P companies having inflated price-to-earnings ratios. He's unconvinced that AGI is imminent or that AI model providers will capture most of the economic value, believing AI may become a competitive commodity where value flows to companies *using* AI rather than those providing it.

• **Diversification strategy shift**: He's moving 25% of his S&P 500 holdings into a mix of: S&P 500 value index funds (excluding high P/E ratio stocks), mid-cap stocks, international index funds (for geographic diversification), and small-cap stocks (which have more normal valuations and haven't experienced the same speculative growth).

• **Rationale for small-cap exposure**: Small-cap stocks may benefit if AI becomes a widely-available tool that helps smaller companies compete, and their valuations don't require extraordinary future performance to justify current prices. However, he acknowledges this is risky—small-cap funds have returned half what the S&P 500 has over the past decade—which is why he's keeping 75% in the S&P 500.
