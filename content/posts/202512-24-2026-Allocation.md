Traditional wisdom still applies, but with caveats: For 30+ years, investing in low-cost US equity index funds (like S&P 500) has been the best strategy for most people—better than active trading or paying financial advisors who take percentage fees that compound negatively over time. These funds automatically weight investments by company market capitalization and require minimal effort or expertise.

>Valuations are especially high in the US. The S&P500 trades at 23 times forward earnings, near the top of its historical range. While the Nasdaq’s 30× trailing P/E is well below the dotcom bubble peak, it still reflects significant optimism. Outside the US, valuations are more moderate: European and Chinese equities are 10% and 7% above their 20-year average valuations, respectively, and Japan’s index trades at a discount to its long-term average.

The S&P 500 has become dangerously concentrated: The top 10 companies now represent approximately 38% of the S&P 500's value (a historic concentration level), with Nvidia alone accounting for 7%. This means what was once a diversified investment across 500 companies is now heavily weighted toward a small number of tech giants, many of which are betting heavily on AI.

Concerns about AI speculation and valuations: The creator views the current AI boom as potentially speculative or bubble-like, with many top S&P companies having inflated price-to-earnings ratios. He's unconvinced that AGI is imminent or that AI model providers will capture most of the economic value, believing AI may become a competitive commodity where value flows to companies using AI rather than those providing it.

Diversification strategy shift He's moving 25% of his S&P 500 holdings into a mix of: S&P 500 value index funds (excluding high P/E ratio stocks), mid-cap stocks, international index funds (for geographic diversification), and small-cap stocks (which have more normal valuations and haven't experienced the same speculative growth).

Over the last 30 years, equities, gold and REITs are winners, but the 60/40 has delivered steady returns in most time periods Relative performance of selected assets over discrete five-year periods from 1995-2025

Rationale for small-cap exposure Small-cap stocks may benefit if AI becomes a widely-available tool that helps smaller companies compete, and their valuations don't require extraordinary future performance to justify current prices. However, he acknowledges this is risky—small-cap funds have returned half what the S&P 500 has over the past decade—which is why he's keeping 75% in the S&P 500.
