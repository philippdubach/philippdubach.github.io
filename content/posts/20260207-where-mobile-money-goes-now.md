  {question = "Did mobile apps make more money than games in 2025?", answer = "Yes, for the first time ever. Non-game apps generated $85.6 billion in in-app purchase revenue in 2025, surpassing games at $81.8 billion. This historic shift was driven primarily by GenAI, social media, and streaming subscriptions."},
  {question = "How much revenue did GenAI apps generate in 2025?", answer = "Generative AI was the biggest contributor to app revenue growth in 2025, adding $3.5 billion. ChatGPT alone accounts for about 40% of consumer spending in the GenAI category, making it the third-highest grossing app globally behind TikTok and Google One."},
  {question = "What is the demographic profile of GenAI app users?", answer = "GenAI app users skew young and male, clustering demographically with Reddit and X (formerly Twitter) rather than mainstream apps like Instagram or Pinterest. This suggests AI apps have not yet crossed into broad consumer adoption."},
  {question = "Which app has the widest cross-generational reach?", answer = "YouTube is the only app that ranks number 1 across every age demographic in the US: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, and 45+. No other app, including TikTok, Instagram, or Facebook, has achieved this level of universal appeal."},

For the first decade of mobile, games made more money than everything else combined. Clash of Clans and Candy Crush built empires on freemium. King went public. Supercell sold for $10 billion. That changed in 2025. {{< img src="apps_vs_games_revenue.png" alt="Line chart showing Apps overtaking Games in mobile IAP revenue in 2025, with Apps at $85.6B and Games at $81.8B" width="80%" >}} Sensor Tower's [State of Mobile 2026](https://sensortower.com/state-of-mobile-2026) report confirms what had been building for years: non-game applications now generate more in-app revenue than games. Apps crossed $85.6 billion in 2025, up 21% year-over-year. Games managed $81.8 billion, barely moving from the year before.

Games peaked in 2021 and flatlined. Apps kept compounding. Subscriptions, which seemed like a novelty in 2018, became the dominant business model for cloud storage, language learning, and now AI. {{< img src="genai_revenue_growth.png" alt="Horizontal bar chart showing GenAI led app revenue growth in 2025 with $3.5B added, more than any other category" width="80%" >}} Generative AI was the biggest contributor. The category added $3.5 billion in IAP revenue in 2025, more than Movies & TV ($2.2B) or Social Media ($2.1B). It went from near-zero in 2022 to the top growth category in three years. {{< img src="genai_rise.png" alt="Combined bar and line chart showing GenAI app downloads rising from 0.05B in 2021 to 1.45B in 2024, with revenue hitting $1.25B" width="80%" >}} GenAI apps went from 50 million downloads in 2021 to 1.45 billion in 2024. Revenue jumped from essentially nothing to $1.25 billion. ChatGPT alone accounts for 40% of the category's consumer spend. This is just in-app purchases and does not count subscriptions billed outside the app store or enterprise contracts.

The demographics are interesting: AI app users look nothing like the broader internet population. {{< img src="genai_demographics.png" alt="Scatter plot showing GenAI user demographics cluster with Reddit and X (young, male-skewing), not Instagram or Pinterest" width="80%" >}} GenAI users cluster with Reddit and X. Young, male, tech-adjacent. They look nothing like Instagram (young women) or Pinterest (older women) or even Facebook (everyone's parents). The AI audience is still a niche, even as revenue scales.

This explains where AI companies advertise: {{< img src="ai_advertising_skew.png" alt="Horizontal bar chart showing AI companies over-index on LinkedIn (+45%) and under-index on Pinterest (-13%) and YouTube (-9%)" width="80%" >}} LinkedIn gets 45% more GenAI ad impressions than its share of the general population would suggest. Pinterest and YouTube get less. The AI marketing playbook is simple: find professionals, not consumers.

One place where AI has found consumers: shopping. {{< img src="ai_retail_referrals.png" alt="Stacked area chart showing GenAI referral traffic to major retailers growing from ~$5M to ~$51M between Oct 2024 and Dec 2025" width="80%" >}} Referral traffic from AI tools to major retailers grew roughly 7x between October 2024 and December 2025. People are asking ChatGPT what to buy, and then buying it. Amazon captures the largest share, but Walmart, Target, and Home Depot have all seen triple-digit percentage growth in AI-driven traffic. Still less than 1% of total retail traffic. But growing fast.

One pattern stands out: {{< img src="youtube_dominance.png" alt="Table showing YouTube is the #1 app across every age group in the US (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45+)" width="80%" >}} YouTube is the top app across every age demographic. Every single one. 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45+. No other app has achieved this. Not TikTok (appears for youngest and oldest, vanishes in the middle). Not Instagram (fades with age). Not Facebook (rises with age). YouTube alone spans generations.

Finally, Waymo: {{< img src="waymo_penetration.png" alt="Line chart showing Waymo's penetration of Lyft and Uber users rising to ~4% and ~3% respectively by Q4 2025" width="80%" >}} Waymo accounts for about 4% of Lyft users and 3% of Uber users nationally, despite operating in only a handful of cities. In its active markets (San Francisco, Phoenix), market share is closer to 15%. The company has driven 127 million autonomous miles and tripled its ride volume to 15 million trips in 2025.

Mobile is no longer a platform question. It is a distribution question. The winners so far: AI companies targeting professionals, YouTube serving everyone, and autonomous vehicles growing quietly in the background.
