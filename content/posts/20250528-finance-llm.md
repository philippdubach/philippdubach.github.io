LLMs make your life easier until they don't.

> Their intrinsic complexity and lack of transparency pose significant challenges, especially in the highly regulated financial sector

Unlike other industries where "the model said so" might suffice, finance demands audit trails, bias detection, 
and explainable decision-makingâ€”requirements that sit uncomfortably with neural networks containing billions of parameters. 
The research highlights a fundamental tension that's about to reshape fintech: 
the same complexity that makes LLMs powerful at parsing market sentiment or generating investment reports also makes them regulatory nightmares 
in a sector where you need to explain every decision to examiners.
