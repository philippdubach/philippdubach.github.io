>We cannot leave decisions about how AI will be built and deployed solely to its practitioners. If we are to effectively regulate this technology, another layer of society—educators, politicians, policymakers [...]—must come to grips with the basics of the mathematics of machine learning.

Over the past few months I had some more time to read, and I picked up Why Machines Learn by Anil Ananthaswamy. The book is an easy read and has a touch of popular science literature but quickly moves into detailed mathematical derivations of the formulas used in AI algorithms. Even if your last lecture was some time ago, don't be afraid of the math. Ananthaswamy provides a strong conceptual history of the mathematics underlying machine learning methods. He starts from vectors and dot products, showing how these aren't just computational steps but geometric transformations that reveal the underlying structure of data. 

It provides great explanations on how a neural network layer applies a linear transformation followed by a nonlinear activation and began to see how vectors in high-dimensional space are being rotated, scaled, and projected in ways that extract meaningful patterns. Sounds fun right?

The book progresses through perceptrons, backpropagation, Principal Component Analysis, Support Vector Machines, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Generative Adversarial Networks. Ananthaswamy weaves together the history of these technologies, while presenting the math and algorithms in an accessible way that offers what he calls a "graded ascent" through increasingly sophisticated concepts. 

For me the book works as an amazing introduction that captures both the elegance and complexity of machine learning. There are more rigorous books on the topic but Ananthaswamy hits the sweet spot with a narrative of the AI journey that introduces the pioneers and their thought processes in developing the math that enabled everything.
