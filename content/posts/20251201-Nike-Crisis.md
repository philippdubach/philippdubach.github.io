In March 2025, Nike [reported its worst revenue decline](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/nike-post-worst-revenue-fall-5-years-stagnant-demand-2025-03-19/) in nearly five years: an 11.5% drop to $11.01 billion. Digital sales fell 20%, app downloads decreased 35%, and store foot traffic declined 11%. The company that once captured roughly half of the US athletic footwear market now faces a crisis that reveals how competitive advantages work, and how quickly they can disappear.

Nike spent decades building dominance through complementary assets: product development, athlete partnerships, and marketing that reinforced premium positioning. These three worked together to create what Porter would call a [sustainable competitive advantage](https://hbr.org/1996/11/what-is-strategy). When all three are strong, you can charge premium prices and maintain gross margins above 40%. When you systematically weaken each pillar simultaneously, the advantage collapses.

Nike's gross margins peaked around 45% in the mid-2010s. By fiscal 2025, [margins had compressed to 42.7%](https://investors.nike.com/investors/news-events-and-reports/investor-news/investor-news-details/2025/NIKE-Inc--Reports-Fiscal-2025-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Results/default.aspx), a decline of 190 basis points, primarily due to higher discounts and unfavorable sales channel mix. The direct-to-consumer shift that was supposed to improve margins actually made things worse because it reduced retail presence at exactly the wrong moment. Competitors filled the shelf space Nike vacated.

The most significant strategic shift came in 2020 when Nike hired [John Donahoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Donahoe), a former Bain consultant and eBay CEO, to replace [Mark Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Parker). Donahoe accelerated the direct-to-consumer transition, terminating hundreds of wholesale accounts. The theory was sound: wholesale margins are 30-35% after retailer markups, while direct sales can reach 50% or higher. But retail shelf space is a zero-sum game. When Nike pulled out, competitors immediately filled the void. Running brands like On and Hoka, which had been developing new sole technology and cushioning systems, suddenly had access to prime retail real estate. On's CloudTec and Hoka's maximalist cushioning gained visibility precisely when Nike was reducing its retail presence. Nike improved its direct-to-consumer margins but reduced its total addressable market. The company assumed consumers would follow it online, but many didn't. Instead, they discovered alternatives in physical stores.

The product development problem was structural. Donahoe reorganized Nike from sport-specific teams to general categories: Men's, Women's, and Kids'. This destroyed the organizational capabilities that had driven product development. The running team understood biomechanics and materials science. The basketball team understood court dynamics and performance requirements. When you collapse these into general categories, you lose the specialized knowledge that creates functional differentiation. Senior designers and executives left for competitors. The company began relying more heavily on retro basketball shoes, which worked during the pandemic. But when trends shifted toward lower-profile shoes like Adidas Sambas, Nike was left holding excess inventory. Inventory turnover deteriorated, and gross margins compressed further.

The combination of reduced retail presence and weaker product development created a gap that competitors exploited. On's revenue grew from [$330 million in 2020 to $1.8 billion by 2025](https://investors.on-running.com/financials-and-filings/financial-releases/news-details/2025/On-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Results-and-the-Filing-of-its-Annual-Report-on-Form-20-F-for-2024/default.aspx). Hoka's parent company, Deckers, saw Hoka revenue increase from [$352 million in 2020 to $1.4 billion](https://www.deckers.com/investors/financial-information/annual-reports). Moody's has noted that emerging brands like On and Hoka have intensified competition, contributing to Nike's 10% revenue drop and [42% decline in EBIT](https://www.reuters.com/business/moodys-downgrades-nikes-debt-ratings-cost-pressures-2025-11-13/).
The athlete partnership strategy collapsed. Roger Federer left for On, which he partially owns. Harry Kane signed with Skechers. Simone Biles went to Athleta. Josh Allen moved to New Balance. Tiger Woods left to start his own brand. These departures matter because athlete partnerships aren't just marketing expenses. They're product development inputs and distribution channels. When Michael Jordan worked with Nike in the 1980s, the collaboration produced the Air Jordan line, which generated over [$5 billion in annual revenue](https://investors.nike.com/investors/news-events-and-reports/investor-news/default.aspx) by 2023. The real problem isn't that athlete deals are more expensive today. It's that Nike lost athletes because it was no longer the clear leader in product development. Federer left because On was developing better running shoes.

The marketing shift was perhaps the most visible change, and the most damaging to brand positioning. Nike's historical advertising was unapologetically about winning. The tagline "Just Do It" was aggressive. The tone was confident, sometimes arrogant. This worked because it matched the product and the athletes. When you have the best products and the best athletes, you can be arrogant. When you don't, arrogance becomes empty posturing. Under Donahoe, the messaging softened. Ads became more whimsical, focused on participation rather than victory, and emphasized social issues. For Nike, this represented a departure from what had made the brand distinctive. More importantly, it didn't match the product. Without new products and top athletes, the softer messaging couldn't sustain premium positioning. Consumers saw the disconnect. The ads said "just try your best" while competitors were saying "we make the best products for winning." The market chose the latter.

Then came the tariffs. In early 2025, the Trump administration implemented "reciprocal tariffs" on imports from various countries. Nike manufactures 95% of its shoes and 60% of its apparel in Southeast Asia, particularly in Vietnam, China, Indonesia, and Cambodia ([LinkedIn Analysis](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/challenges-strategies-nikes-supply-chain-risk-2025-kamyar-farnoush-u0pxf)). While rates were later adjusted downward, Nike still faces an estimated [$1 billion to $1.5 billion in additional tariff costs](https://apnews.com/article/f84fe37e11dbf4b439d8655d3533380c) over the next few years. Nike has announced plans to reduce China's share of its U.S. footwear imports from 16% to single digits by fiscal 2026, but this requires building new supplier relationships, retooling factories, and establishing new logistics networks. The transition will take years and cost billions.

The tariff situation highlights a broader issue with Nike's supply chain strategy. The company has concentrated manufacturing in a small number of countries to achieve scale economies and cost efficiency. This works well when trade policy is stable, but when trade policy shifts, the concentration becomes a vulnerability. This is what economists call path dependency. Past decisions constrain future options. Nike focused on cost efficiency, but this created exposure to trade policy risk that the company can't easily unwind. When Vietnam shut down factories during COVID-19, Nike lost three months of production.

The company's response has been to return to its original formula. In September 2024, [Nike replaced Donahoe with Elliott Hill](https://apnews.com/article/6f439a3f5a62e9b2380aaf3e21c7e220), a 30-year company veteran. Hill is pushing product development as part of [Nike's "Sport Offense" strategy](https://investors.nike.com/investors/news-events-and-reports/investor-news/investor-news-details/2025/NIKE-Inc--Reports-Fiscal-2025-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Results/default.aspx). There are early signs this might work, though Nike has faced multiple consecutive quarters of declining sales as it works to stabilize the business.

Nike's competitors have used the past few years to build stronger positions. On has established itself in running with new sole technology and Federer's endorsement, growing from $330 million to $1.8 billion in revenue. Hoka has gained market share with its maximalist cushioning, growing from [$352 million to $1.4 billion](https://www.deckers.com/investors/financial-information/annual-reports). These brands aren't going away.

The competitive environment has fundamentally changed. In the 2010s, Nike could dominate through scale and brand power alone. Today, smaller brands can compete effectively by focusing on specific sports or product categories. Social media and direct-to-consumer platforms have lowered barriers to entry. Nike can't simply return to its old formula and expect to regain dominance because the structural advantages that made the old formula work no longer exist.

But here's what I think is really happening. Nike's crisis wasn't caused by a single mistake or even a series of mistakes. It was caused by a fundamental misunderstanding of how competitive advantages work. The company treated its brand, its products, and its athlete partnerships as separate assets that could be managed independently. But they're not separate. They're complementary assets that create value only when they work together. When you weaken one, you weaken all of them. When you weaken all of them simultaneously, the advantage collapses completely. The direct-to-consumer transition, organizational restructuring, and marketing shift each made sense in isolation. But together, they destroyed the system that created Nike's competitive advantage.

The company focused on efficiency and margins while ignoring the fact that its real advantage came from being the best at product development, athlete relationships, and brand positioning simultaneously.

The tariffs added pressure at the worst possible time, but they're not the root cause. The root cause is that Nike systematically weakened its competitive advantages and then tried to maintain premium pricing without the product foundation to support it. The market responded predictably. Consumers found alternatives. Retailers filled shelf space with other brands. Athletes left for companies that were actually developing new products. Recovery will be harder than the decline because the structural advantages that made Nike dominant no longer exist.
