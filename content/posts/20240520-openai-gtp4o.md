OpenAI's GPT-4o launch is a classic Silicon Valley competitive strategy disguised as a product announcement.

> GPT-4o is 2x faster, half the price, and has 5x higher rate limits compared to GPT-4 Turbo

The real headline isn't the multimodal wizardry — though watching an AI tutor walk through math problems or harmonize in real-time is genuinely impressive. It's the economics. OpenAI is essentially paying developers to build on their platform while making it prohibitively expensive for competitors to match these specs profitably.

The free tier expansion is equally calculated. By giving ChatGPT's 100+ million users access to frontier AI capabilities, OpenAI creates a consumer expectation that every other AI assistant will struggle to meet. It's the Amazon playbook: lose money on the product, make it back on the ecosystem.

That being said, the technical achievement shouldn't be understated—training a single model end-to-end across text, vision, and audio represents a genuine breakthrough in multimodal AI. Real-time voice conversation with natural interruptions moves us from "chatbot" to something approaching actual dialogue. Strip away the demos and you're left with a company making an aggressive bet that they can outspend the competition into submission. Whether that works depends on how quickly Google, Anthropic, and others can respond—and whether OpenAI's cash reserves outlast their patience. The AI wars just got expensive. For everyone except OpenAI's customers.
