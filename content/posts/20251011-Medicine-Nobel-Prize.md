faq:
- question: Who won the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine?
  answer: Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi were jointly awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance. Their work identified regulatory T cells, which prevent the immune system from attacking the body's own tissues.
- question: What is peripheral immune tolerance?
  answer: Peripheral immune tolerance is the mechanism by which regulatory T cells prevent other immune cells from mistakenly attacking the body's own organs and tissues. This discovery, recognized by the 2025 Nobel Prize, explains how the immune system stays balanced and has opened new avenues for treating autoimmune diseases and cancer.
- question: Where can I read the Nobel Prize popular science explanation?
  answer: 'The Nobel Prize organization publishes a "Popular Science" document for each prize, providing an accessible, layman-friendly description of the winning discoveries. The 2025 Medicine prize popular science PDF is available on the nobelprize.org website and covers peripheral immune tolerance at roughly a university level.'
- question: How did Mary Brunkow find out she won the Nobel Prize?
  answer: Mary Brunkow initially ignored a call from Sweden, thinking it was spam. She learned about her Nobel Prize from an AP photographer who came to her Seattle home in the early hours of the morning to inform her of the award.

[Mary E. Brunkow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_E._Brunkow), along with [Fred Ramsdell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Ramsdell) and [Shimon Sakaguchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Sakaguchi), just won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2025 for their discoveries concerning [peripheral immune tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_tolerance) and [regulatory T cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell).

>Brunkow, meanwhile, got the news of her prize from an AP photographer who came to her Seattle home in the early hours of the morning. She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel Committee. "My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: 'That's just, that's spam of some sort.'"

The reason why this is worth sharing (besides their fantastic work on the Foxp3 gene, which has implications for autoimmune disease treatment and cancer immunotherapy) is that the Nobel Prize always has a "[Popular Science](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2025/10/popular-medicineprize2025-2.pdf)" publication with nice layman descriptions of what was discovered and why it was important. It's an in-depth look at the discoveries at a university level I would say. Worth a read!
