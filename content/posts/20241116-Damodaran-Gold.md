faq:
- question: Why does Damodaran call gold a collectible rather than an asset?
  answer: Damodaran classifies gold as a collectible because it generates no cash flows, pays no dividends, and produces no earnings. Unlike stocks or bonds, gold cannot be valued through discounted cash flow analysis. Its price is driven by perception, sentiment, and its historical role as a store of value, not by any measurable economic output.
- question: Can you value gold using traditional investment analysis?
  answer: 'No. Damodaran''s framework shows that gold cannot be "valued" in the traditional sense because valuation requires expected future cash flows, which gold does not produce. You can only price gold by analyzing the drivers of market sentiment, momentum, and macroeconomic conditions, but you cannot assign it an intrinsic value the way you would a business or bond.'
- question: Why would a value investor hold gold despite Buffett's criticism?
  answer: Even investors who follow Buffett's productive-asset philosophy may hold gold as insurance against tail risks such as hyperinflation and catastrophic market dislocations. In scenarios where correlations across asset classes converge toward one and traditional diversification fails, gold has historically provided protection. The case for gold is not as an investment that compounds wealth, but as a hedge against the specific macro uncertainties where other assets break down.
- question: How does gold function as tail risk insurance in a portfolio?
  answer: Gold acts as portfolio insurance against extreme events where conventional assets fail simultaneously. During periods of severe market stress, correlations between stocks and bonds tend to rise, reducing the effectiveness of traditional diversification. Gold's value as insurance lies in its tendency to hold or gain value during these tail-risk scenarios, including hyperinflation, currency crises, and systemic market dislocations.

[Aswath Damodaran's](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/) latest analysis into gold's 2025 surge walks through gold's contradictory nature as a collectible rather than an asset with cash flows, showing why it's impossible to "value" gold in the traditional sense, yet entirely possible to understand what drives its pricing. 

Even though gold is outperforming almost all other assets in my portfolio this year I fundamentally don't like holding it. I'm a [Buffett disciple](https://buffett.cnbc.com/2011-berkshire-hathaway-annual-meeting/): gold is an unproductive asset that generates no earnings, pays no dividends. 

But Damodaran's framework helps to understand why tolerating it anyway might be worth it. It's less an investment than insurance against the tail risks of hyperinflation and catastrophic market dislocations, scenarios where correlations go to one and traditional diversification fails. The dissonance between what I believe intellectually (productive assets compound wealth) and what I'm actually doing (holding some gold anyway) probably says more about 2025's macro uncertainty than any principled investment thesis.
