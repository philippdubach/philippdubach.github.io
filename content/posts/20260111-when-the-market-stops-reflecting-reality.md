  {question = "Why has the stock market decoupled from the economy?", answer = "The S&P 500 has structurally decoupled from everyday economic reality through two mechanisms: concentration (top 10 stocks now represent 40% of the index) and passive investing (60% of flows are mechanical, price-insensitive index fund purchases).

This creates systematic underweighting of the fastest-growing names and structural headwinds for active management regardless of manager skill."},
  {question = "How does passive investing affect market corrections?", answer = "In a passive-dominated market (60% of flows), corrections trigger mechanical selling rather than value-based buying. Index funds sell proportionally to their holdings without evaluating whether prices have become attractive. This reduces the stabilizing bid that active managers traditionally provided, potentially making corrections steeper and faster."},
  {question = "What is the K-shaped economy and how does it affect markets?", answer = "The K-shaped economy describes a bifurcated recovery where some segments thrive while others struggle. This produces a K-shaped market where median household experience diverges from median stock index performance. Consumer welfare can deteriorate materially through rising healthcare costs, unaffordable housing, and high grocery prices without meaningfully impacting index returns."},

A friend recently recommended [Steve Eisman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Eisman)'s podcast to me. Eisman, you might recall, is the hedge fund manager portrayed in The Big Short who famously bet against subprime mortgages before the 2008 crisis. In his [most recent episode](https://www.youtube.com/@RealEismanPlaybook), Eisman laid out a thesis for something that made me uncomfortable ever since the [Covid-19 stock market crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash) recovery: the U.S. equity market has structurally decoupled from everyday economic reality.

I've written [about market concentration](https://philippdubach.com/posts/how-ai-is-shaping-my-investment-portfolio-for-2026/) in my 2026 portfolio allocation. But Eisman's point isn't just about concentration. It's about what this concentration means for everyone else. Consider what happens to consumer-exposed sectors. Combined, healthcare, consumer discretionary, and consumer staples have fallen from 38% of the index in 2015 to just 25% today. This matters because roughly [70% of U.S. GDP is consumer-driven](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DPCERE1Q156NBEA). The traditional logic was simple: consumer spending drives the economy, consumer stocks reflect that spending, and therefore the stock market reflects economic health. That relationship has broken down.

The disconnect shows up in daily American life. Healthcare costs continue rising, housing remains unaffordable for many, and grocery prices have yet to normalize. These are real pressures on real households. Yet the S&P 500 gained 16% in 2025, with the Nasdaq up 21%. The market doesn't care about rent or insurance premiums because the companies reflecting those costs barely register in the index anymore. As Eisman puts it:

>The market has become unmoored from everyday life.

This creates a structural problem for active managers that compounds over time. When [NVIDIA alone represents 7.7% of the S&P 500](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500), Apple 6.8%, and Microsoft 6.1%, most institutional mandates physically prevent managers from holding proportional positions. Risk limits cap initial positions at perhaps 5% of assets under management. Sector allocation rules require diversification across all eleven sectors. The result is systematic underweighting of the fastest-growing names. Meanwhile, the bottom five sectors combined represent just 14% of the index. Real estate, with 31 constituents, accounts for barely 2%. Why dedicate research resources to an entire sector that can only marginally move your portfolio?

The rise of passive investing amplifies all of this. Index funds now control roughly 60% of flows versus 40% for active managers. When money enters an index fund, it buys stocks in proportion to their existing market cap. Large positions grow larger. There's no portfolio manager deciding NVIDIA looks expensive. The buying is mechanical, price-insensitive, and self-reinforcing. This doesn't eliminate price discovery entirely.

Eisman points to Oracle's Q3 2025 experience: shares surged after reporting a massive backlog, then corrected below pre-earnings levels once investors realized the backlog concentrated in a single customer with questionable financing. Active managers still matter. They just matter less.

In a normal correction, sellers meet buyers who evaluate whether prices have become attractive. In a passive-dominated market, redemptions trigger mechanical selling. Index funds don't decide that a 20% drawdown makes stocks compelling. They sell what they own in proportion to what they own. If active managers control only 40% of flows, the stabilizing bid may prove insufficient. The [February-April 2025 correction](https://www.reuters.com/markets/) saw the S&P fall 19% peak-to-trough. Eisman's assessment: if an actual recession materializes, or if AI spending disappoints expectations,

>the decline will almost certainly be steeper. It will be fast and very ugly.

There's also a tax dimension creating behavioral lock-in. Years of technology outperformance have embedded massive unrealized capital gains in both retail and institutional portfolios. Selling NVIDIA means realizing those gains and paying taxes on them. Investors avoid this until forced by margin calls, redemptions, or actual fundamental collapse. This creates asymmetric liquidity: plenty of buyers on the way up, scarce ones on the way down.

What does this mean for portfolio construction? First, understand that traditional cap-weighted benchmarks now represent a concentrated bet on technology and AI capital expenditure. Second, active management faces structural headwinds that have nothing to do with manager skill. Third, liquidity assumptions that held in previous corrections may not hold in the next one. And fourth, consumer welfare can deteriorate materially without meaningfully impacting index returns. The K-shaped economy produces a K-shaped market, where the experience of median households and the experience of median stock index performance have genuinely diverged.
