  {question = "What is AlphaFold 3 and how is it different from AlphaFold 2?", answer = "AlphaFold 3 is Google DeepMind's AI model that predicts the structure and interactions of all biological molecules, including proteins, DNA, RNA, and small molecules. Unlike AlphaFold 2, which only predicted individual protein structures, AlphaFold 3 models how these molecules interact with each other, which is critical for understanding how drugs bind to their targets."},
  {question = "Why did Google release AlphaFold 3 for free?", answer = "Google made AlphaFold 3 freely available to researchers through the AlphaFold Server for non-commercial use, while keeping commercial rights through Isomorphic Labs. This mirrors Google's classic platform strategy: build widespread dependency on free infrastructure, then monetize through commercial licensing and cloud services once adoption is entrenched."},
  {question = "How will AlphaFold 3 impact drug discovery?", answer = "AlphaFold 3 could significantly reduce the cost and timeline of drug development by predicting molecular interactions with 50% better accuracy than existing methods. By modeling how proteins interact with potential drug molecules, it helps researchers identify promising drug candidates faster, potentially saving billions in laboratory testing costs."},
  {question = "What is Google's business strategy with AlphaFold and Isomorphic Labs?", answer = "Google is using AlphaFold as a platform play in life sciences. Free academic access builds adoption and dependency, while Isomorphic Labs handles commercial licensing for pharmaceutical companies. With partnerships worth up to $3 billion with Eli Lilly and Novartis, Google is positioning itself to own the infrastructure layer of AI-driven drug discovery."},

Nothing says "we're serious about dominating a market" quite like giving away breakthrough technology for free. Google's latest move with AlphaFold 3 might be their most audacious version of this strategy yet.

This isn't just an incremental improvement - While previous versions of AlphaFold could predict protein structures, AlphaFold 3 models the interactions between proteins, DNA, RNA, and small molecules. It's the difference between having a parts catalog and understanding how the entire machine works.

Drug discovery typically costs billions and takes decades. If AlphaFold 3 can meaningfully accelerate that process - even by modest percentages—the value creation is staggering. Yet Google is handing it to researchers for free through the AlphaFold Server, with the predictable caveat of commercial restrictions. Is this Google's cloud strategy playing out in life sciences? Establish the platform, get everyone dependent on your infrastructure, then monetize the ecosystem. The pharmaceutical industry, already grappling with AI disruption, now faces a world where molecular interactions can be predicted with "50% better accuracy" than existing methods. The real question isn't whether AI will transform drug discovery - it's whether Google will own that transformation.
