[[faq]]
question = "How much does Japan hold in foreign assets?"
answer = "Japan holds roughly $5 trillion in foreign assets, making it the world's largest creditor nation. The US alone accounts for approximately ¥342 trillion in bonds and equities, with Japan being the largest foreign holder of US Treasuries at over $1.1 trillion."

[[faq]]
question = "Why are Japanese investors considering repatriating capital?"
answer = "Japanese 30-year government bond yields have risen from below 1% (where they sat from 2019 through early 2024) to above 3%. This has collapsed the yield spread between developed market bonds and JGBs from 400 basis points to roughly 100, reducing the incentive to hold foreign assets for yield."

[[faq]]
question = "What's the difference between a carry trade unwind and capital repatriation?"
answer = "A carry trade unwind involves speculative positions being rapidly closed, as happened in August 2024 when the S&P dropped 6% in three days. Capital repatriation is the slower but larger process of institutional investors like pension funds and life insurers actually selling foreign assets and bringing capital home."

[[faq]]
question = "How would Japanese selling affect the Treasury market?"
answer = "Treasury market depth has deteriorated since 2020, with primary dealers holding smaller inventories and thinner liquidity provision. A sustained seller of size would arrive into a market less equipped to absorb flow than at any point since the Global Financial Crisis."

Japan holds roughly [$5 trillion in foreign assets](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G_j8tfLXEAA1djy?format=jpg&name=medium). The US alone accounts for [¥342 trillion](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G_j8tfKWwAAesgX?format=jpg&name=medium) in bonds and equities.

Japanese [30-year yields sat below 1%](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G_j8tfQWoAADp2D?format=jpg&name=medium) from 2019 through early 2024. They're now above 3%. The [yield spread](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G_j8tfRXgAAgGPV?format=jpg&name=medium) between developed market bonds and JGBs has collapsed from 400 basis points to roughly 100. The yen carry trade that defined Japanese institutional behavior since the 1990s, borrow cheap at home and invest abroad for yield, suddenly has added friction.

Japanese life insurers and pension funds have duration-matching obligations. If domestic yields offer adequate returns with lower currency risk, the marginal incentive to hold Treasuries weakens. GPIF, the world's largest pension fund, doesn't need to reach for yield in US credit markets when JGBs pay 3%.

This doesn't mean Japanese investors dump everything tomorrow. Institutional rebalancing is glacial. Currency hedging costs matter and existing positions have different maturity profiles. Treasury market depth has deteriorated since 2020. Primary dealers hold smaller inventories. Liquidity provision is thinner. A sustained seller of size, which Japanese institutions would be, arrives into a market less equipped to absorb flow than at any point since the GFC.

The second-order effects compound. Japanese selling pressures Treasury yields higher. Higher yields strengthen the dollar near-term but raise US borrowing costs. If Japan's repatriation triggers broader reserve manager concern about duration exposure, the feedback loop accelerates.

The consensus view remains that Japan is trapped. Any meaningful tightening implodes JGB markets where the BOJ owns half of outstanding supply. But the data suggests something else. Yields are rising, volatility is elevated, and the market is absorbing it. The trap might be less binding than assumed.

The yen carry trade unwound violently in August 2024 and the S&P dropped 6% in three days. That was positioning adjustment. Repatriation of actual assets would be slower but larger.

When a $5 trillion portfolio starts rebalancing toward domestic assets, you don't need to predict the timing. You need to be positioned for a situation where the marginal Treasury buyer becomes a marginal seller. What happens in Japan doesn't stay in Japan.
