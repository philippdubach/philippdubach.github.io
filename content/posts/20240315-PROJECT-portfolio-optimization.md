My first encounter with quantitative portfolio optimization came during my undergraduate studies.  Inspired by Meucci's [Risk and Asset Allocation](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-27904-4) as well as Diamond and Boyd's [Stanford teaching on Convex Optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/teaching.html) I set out to build my first "optimal" portfolio.

With a healthy dose of home bias, I developed what would eventually be published as [A Python integration of practical asset allocation based on modern portfolio theory and its advancements](https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24351)

Looking back, the project feels embarrassingly naiveâ€”and surprisingly foundational. While it earned some recognition at the time, it now serves as a valuable reminder: sometimes the best foundation is built before you know enough to doubt yourself.
