faq:
- question: "How does oral semaglutide work if only 1% is absorbed?"
  answer: "Oral semaglutide uses the permeation enhancer SNAC (salcaprozate sodium) to temporarily buffer stomach acid and fluidize gastric cell membranes, allowing a small fraction of the peptide to cross into the bloodstream. The resulting bioavailability is roughly 0.4 to 1%, meaning over 99% of each pill is destroyed. The oral 25mg daily dose requires approximately 280x more active ingredient than the equivalent weekly injection."
- question: "Is orforglipron better than oral semaglutide for weight loss?"
  answer: "In the ACHIEVE-3 head-to-head trial, orforglipron was superior to oral semaglutide on both HbA1c reduction and weight loss at 52 weeks. Orforglipron is also a small molecule rather than a peptide, meaning it requires no SNAC enhancer, no 30-minute fasting window, and no cold chain storage. However, ACHIEVE-3 compared orforglipron against semaglutide 7mg and 14mg doses, not the higher 25mg Wegovy pill dose approved for obesity."
- question: "What is the current GLP-1 market size and who is winning?"
  answer: "Combined Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly GLP-1 revenue reached approximately $70 billion in 2025. Lilly's tirzepatide franchise (Mounjaro + Zepbound) generated $36.5 billion, surpassing Novo's semaglutide franchise at roughly $33 billion. Lilly holds 57% US GLP-1 market share as of mid-2025."
- question: "Will oral GLP-1 pills expand the obesity market or replace injections?"
  answer: "The statin precedent suggests oral pills will expand the market rather than cannibalize it. After generic atorvastatin launched in 2011, total statin use expanded from 31 million to 92 million Americans by 2019, a 197% increase. Current GLP-1 penetration is under 5% of eligible US adults versus 35%+ for statins, implying substantial expansion as oral delivery lowers barriers to initiation and improves persistence."
- question: "When does semaglutide's patent expire?"
  answer: "Semaglutide's core US patent expires December 5, 2031, with formulation patents extending to 2033. International patents in Canada, China, India, and Brazil are expiring in 2026. Tirzepatide patents extend into the mid-2030s, giving Eli Lilly a structural advantage in the oral GLP-1 market."
- question: "What oral GLP-1 weight loss pills are coming in 2026?"
  answer: "Novo Nordisk launched the oral Wegovy pill (semaglutide 25mg) in January 2026. Eli Lilly's orforglipron has an FDA target date of April 2026. Behind them, Novo's oral amycretin enters Phase 3 in 2026, Structure Therapeutics' aleniglipron targets mid-2026 Phase 3 start, and Viking Therapeutics' VK2735 oral showed promising Phase 2 data but had high discontinuation rates."

>Novo Nordisk spent decades and $1.8 billion learning how to get a peptide past the gut. Eli Lilly looked at the same problem and decided to skip it entirely.

Your gastrointestinal tract is a 30-foot disassembly line for proteins. Acid denatures them, pepsin cleaves them, trypsin finishes the job, and the mucus layer blocks whatever survives. Sean Geiger's excellent [history of oral peptides](https://seangeiger.substack.com/p/a-brief-history-of-oral-peptides) traces the full arc: the first attempt at oral insulin was in 1922. Over a hundred years and thirteen companies later, no oral insulin exists.

Novo Nordisk spent decades and $1.8 billion acquiring the technology to get around this problem. The result, approved in December 2025 as [oral Wegovy for obesity](https://www.endocrinologyadvisor.com/news/fda-approves-oral-wegovy-for-weight-management/), is a pill that destroys **99%** of its own active ingredient before the remaining fraction reaches the bloodstream. The oral 25mg daily dose uses roughly 280x more semaglutide than the equivalent weekly injection. This is the best that peptide oral delivery can do. Eli Lilly looked at the same problem and decided to skip it entirely, building a small molecule oral GLP-1 that isn't a peptide at all.

That divergence in approach is the most consequential strategic split in pharma right now. It will determine who captures the majority of a market that [Goldman Sachs projects](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/anti-obesity-drug-market) at **$100+ billion by 2030** and that [J.P. Morgan estimates](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/current-events/obesity-drugs) will reach **30 million US users** within five years.

## Oral semaglutide and the bioavailability trap

Sean Geiger's [history of oral peptides](https://seangeiger.substack.com/p/a-brief-history-of-oral-peptides) traces the science well. The technology that makes oral semaglutide possible is SNAC (salcaprozate sodium), a permeation enhancer developed by Emisphere Technologies starting in the 1990s. Novo partnered with Emisphere in 2007 and [acquired the company outright in 2020](https://www.novonordisk.com/content/nncorp/global/en/news-and-media/news-and-ir-materials/news-details.html?id=916472). SNAC does three things simultaneously: it buffers local stomach pH to suppress pepsin, prevents semaglutide from clumping into inactive oligomers, and temporarily fluidizes gastric cell membranes so the drug can cross. The [EMA's public assessment report](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/rybelsus-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf) puts the resulting bioavailability at roughly **0.4 to 1%**. The [FDA label](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2024/213051s018lbl.pdf) confirms: the vast majority of each dose is destroyed.

This creates a problem that's easy to state and hard to solve. If you need 280x more API per equivalent dose, your manufacturing cost structure is fundamentally different. A [Yale/King's College study published in JAMA](https://www.fastcompany.com/91071415/your-1000-per-month-ozempic-costs-5-to-make-says-study) found injectable semaglutide costs **$0.89 to $4.73 per month** to manufacture at the API level. Scale that by 280x and you get oral API costs somewhere in the range of **$770 to $1,460 per year**, according to [The Medicine Maker's January 2026 analysis](https://themedicinemaker.com/issues/2026/articles/january/oral-glp-1s-won-t-win-on-convenience-they-ll-win-on-cmc/). Still below the selling price. But the margin compression is real, and SNAC itself is a costly excipient.

{{< img src="oral-bioavailability-trap.png" alt="Exhibit showing oral semaglutide requires 280 times more API per dose than injectable Wegovy, with SNAC permeation enhancer achieving only 1 percent bioavailability and destroying 99 percent in the gut through acid pepsin trypsin and mucus, while Eli Lilly orforglipron as a small molecule oral GLP-1 bypasses the peptide delivery problem entirely" width="90%" >}}

SNAC is also oddly specific. Geiger [notes](https://seangeiger.substack.com/p/a-brief-history-of-oral-peptides) that Novo tried it with liraglutide, a closely related GLP-1 analog, and it failed because liraglutide forms oligomers that SNAC can't break apart. After over three decades of work, exactly two FDA-approved oral peptide drugs using permeation enhancers exist: Rybelsus/oral Wegovy (SNAC) and Mycapssa (oral octreotide for acromegaly, a different enhancer called TPE). That's the entire commercial output of the field.

## Orforglipron: Lilly's structural advantage

Eli Lilly's [orforglipron](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-superior-oral-semaglutide-head) is not an oral peptide. It's a non-peptide small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist that activates the same receptor through a completely different mechanism. Discovered by Chugai Pharmaceutical and licensed by Lilly in 2018, orforglipron requires no SNAC, no fasting window, no cold chain storage, and is manufactured through standard chemical synthesis rather than solid-phase peptide synthesis. The bioavailability problem doesn't apply because the molecule was designed from the ground up to survive the gut.

The clinical data supports the structural thesis. In [ACHIEVE-3](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-superior-oral-semaglutide-head) (1,698 patients with type 2 diabetes, 52 weeks), orforglipron at 12mg and 36mg was superior to oral semaglutide on both HbA1c reduction and weight loss: the first head-to-head victory over Novo's oral product. In [ATTAIN-2](https://www.appliedclinicaltrialsonline.com/view/eli-lilly-oral-glp1-orforglipron-efficacy-safety-injectable-phaseiii-trial) (obesity with type 2 diabetes), orforglipron delivered **10.5%** weight loss at 72 weeks versus 2.2% on placebo. And in the most telling trial of all, [ATTAIN-MAINTAIN](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-orforglipron-helped-people-maintain-weight-loss-after), patients who switched from injectable Wegovy or Mounjaro to oral orforglipron maintained their weight within **0.9 kg** over 52 weeks. A pill that holds the gains of an injection.

{{< readnext slug="novo-nordisks-post-patent-strategy" >}}

Lilly [submitted the NDA](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-successful-third-phase-3-trial) with a priority review voucher. FDA approval is expected in the first half of 2026. The company is investing [$6.5 billion in a dedicated oral manufacturing facility](https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/pharmaceutical-chemicals/Lilly-pour-65-billion-GLP/103/web/2025/09) and $27 billion total in US manufacturing capacity. That's a bet you make when you think you're building for a market that doesn't exist yet.

## The $70 billion duopoly and its widening crack

The numbers tell a story of divergence. Combined GLP-1 revenue from Novo and Lilly hit roughly **$70 billion in 2025**. But the composition shifted. Lilly's tirzepatide franchise (Mounjaro plus Zepbound) [generated $36.5 billion](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/even-pricing-headwinds-eli-lilly-expects-sales-continue-surge-2026), with Zepbound alone growing **175%** year-over-year. Novo's semaglutide franchise came in around $33 billion, with growth decelerating to roughly 10% in constant exchange rates. [Lilly's US market share hit 57%](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/04/eli-lilly-novo-nordisk-earnings-glp1-market.html) by mid-2025, up from 41% a year earlier. Novo's share fell to 43%.

The stock market has been ruthless in pricing this shift. Novo trades at roughly **$48 per ADR share**, down **65% from its June 2024 peak** of $142, a loss exceeding $350 billion in market cap. The company [guided for a 5 to 13% revenue decline in 2026](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/04/eli-lilly-novo-nordisk-earnings-glp1-market.html), driven by patent expirations in Canada, Brazil, and China, plus pricing pressure from the Trump administration's drug pricing framework. CagriSema, Novo's most important pipeline asset, [disappointed twice](https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/novo-nordisk-cagrisema-obesity-drug-study-results/735854/): 22.7% weight loss in REDEFINE 1 (below the company's own 25% guidance) and 15.7% in REDEFINE 2. [Novo's stock plunged 20% on the first readout alone](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/20/novo-nordisk-shares-plunge-22percent-after-cagrisema-obesity-drug-trial-results.html).

Lilly, by contrast, [guided 2026 revenue at $80 to $83 billion](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/even-pricing-headwinds-eli-lilly-expects-sales-continue-surge-2026), a 25% increase, and [trades near $1,044](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LLY/) with a market cap around **$1 trillion**, the first pharma company to reach that level. Forward P/E: roughly **30x** versus Novo's **12.5x**. That 2.4x valuation premium reflects a simple thesis: Lilly has the better drug (Zepbound [showed 47% greater weight loss](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2416394) than Wegovy in the SURMOUNT-5 head-to-head), the better oral pipeline, and the longer patent runway (tirzepatide patents extend into the mid-2030s versus [semaglutide's core US patent expiring December 2031](https://www.trademarkia.com/news/patents/when-does-the-ozempic-patent-expire)).

{{< img src="novo-vs-lilly-duopoly.png" alt="Exhibit showing Eli Lilly trading at 2.4 times Novo Nordisk forward PE with the GLP-1 market share gap widening, comparing revenue stock performance 2026 guidance semaglutide patent expiry versus tirzepatide patent runway and oral strategy across the $70 billion duopoly" width="90%" >}}

The Hims & Hers saga sits at the chaotic edge of all this. HIMS [launched a $49 per month compounded oral semaglutide pill](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvo-lly-stocks-slide-hims-142700745.html) on February 5, 2026, using unproven liposomal technology with no published bioavailability data. Within four days, [HHS had referred the company to the DOJ](https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2026-2-9-the-glp-1-gold-rush-hits-a-wall-novo-nordisk-sues-hims-and-hers-as-fda-crackdown-triggers-20-stock-crash), Novo had [filed a patent infringement lawsuit](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/8587678/novo-nordisk-nvo-shares-plunge-amid-competition-from-hims-hers-hims), and HIMS had suspended the product. Novo's CEO alleged independent testing of compounded samples showed impurity levels as high as 86%. It's a cautionary tale about what happens when the incentive to undercut $1,000-per-month pricing collides with the actual difficulty of making peptide drugs work orally.

## The Jevons Paradox for GLP-1s

Here's the question I keep coming back to: does oral delivery commoditize GLP-1s, or does it expand the market so dramatically that even with pricing pressure, the opportunity grows?

The statin precedent is the strongest data point we have. After generic atorvastatin launched in 2011, total statin use [expanded from 31 million to 92 million Americans](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10203693/) by 2019, a **197% increase**. Total prescription volume grew 77%. The per-unit price collapsed, but total market volume more than compensated. Updated clinical guidelines, lower copays, and reduced patient resistance combined to pull in millions of people who would never have started therapy at the original price and delivery format.

{{< readnext slug="glp-1-receptor-agonists-and-addiction-the-evidence-is-moving-fast" >}}

The GLP-1 parallel is striking. Current penetration is staggeringly low: [fewer than 5% of eligible US adults](https://icer.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Affordable-Access-to-GLP-1-Obesity-Medications-_-ICER-White-Paper-_-04.09.2025.pdf) are on anti-obesity medication therapy, against **104 million** with obesity. At statin-like penetration rates of 35% or higher, that's a 5 to 10x expansion. Persistence data reinforces the point: only [32% of obesity patients persist at one year and 15% at two years](https://www.primetherapeutics.com/documents/d/primetherapeutics/prime-therapeutics_glp-1-therapy-to-treat-obesity-among-members-without-diabetes_three-year-persistence). Side effects account for 43.7% of discontinuation, financial barriers for 30.9%. An oral weight loss pill that's cheaper, eliminates the injection barrier, and has no fasting restrictions (orforglipron) attacks all three simultaneously.

{{< img src="glp1-jevons-paradox-penetration.png" alt="Exhibit showing GLP-1 anti-obesity medication penetration under 5 percent among eligible US adults compared to statin trajectory from 12 percent to 35 percent penetration after generic launch representing 197 percent expansion, with projected oral GLP-1 expansion to 30 to 35 percent at statin-like levels implying 5 to 10 times market growth from 104 million addressable obese adults" width="90%" >}}

I'm not confident in the specific numbers that Goldman, Morgan Stanley, or UBS are projecting for the anti-obesity medication market. [Goldman initially said $100 billion by 2030, then raised to $130 billion, then pulled back to $95 billion](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/the-anti-obesity-drug-market-may-prove-smaller-than-expected). [Morgan Stanley says $150 billion by 2035](https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/podcasts/thoughts-on-the-market/glp-1-obesity-drug-market-trends-terence-flynn). [UBS says $126 billion by 2029](https://www.ubs.com/global/en/investment-bank/insights-and-data/2024/glp-1-a-medication.html). The range is wide enough to drive a truck through. But I'm fairly confident in the direction: oral delivery lowers the barrier to initiation, improves persistence, and pulls in patients who would never self-inject. The addressable population is enormous. The penetration rate is tiny. And [ICER's cost-effectiveness analysis](https://www.pharmaceuticalcommerce.com/view/icer-releases-cost-analysis-report-obesity-treatments-semaglutide-tirzepatide) found all three major GLP-1s cost-effective at the $100,000 per QALY threshold when calculated at net prices, which means payers have an economic rationale to cover them.

## The oral GLP-1 pipeline

The rest of the pipeline is worth tracking but the outcomes are genuinely uncertain. [Viking's oral VK2735](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/viking-therapeutics-announces-positive-top-line-results-from-phase-2-venture-oral-dosing-trial-of-vk2735-tablet-formulation-in-patients-with-obesity-302533355.html) showed rapid weight loss in Phase 2 (up to **12.2%** at 13 weeks) but a [38% discontinuation rate](https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/viking-oral-obesity-drug-results-study-discontinuationsdata-dropout/758019/) at the highest dose sent the stock down 37%. [Structure Therapeutics' aleniglipron](https://ir.structuretx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/structure-therapeutics-reports-positive-topline-data-access) posted **15.3% placebo-adjusted weight loss** at 36 weeks in Phase 2b, competitive numbers with no plateau, and has $786 million in cash to fund Phase 3. [Pfizer's danuglipron was killed](https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/14/pfizer-discontinue-danuglipron-glp-1-obesity-liver-toxicity/) by liver toxicity in April 2025, the second Pfizer oral GLP-1 failure. [Terns Pharmaceuticals also exited](https://ir.ternspharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/terns-pharmaceuticals-reports-topline-12-week-data-its-phase-2) after weak Phase 2 data and liver enzyme elevations. Oral small molecule GLP-1 development has a meaningful failure rate, and orforglipron's clean safety profile across multiple Phase 3 trials is not something I'd assume the next entrant can replicate.

{{< img src="oral-glp1-pipeline.png" alt="Exhibit showing the full oral GLP-1 drug pipeline scorecard for 2026 with seven candidates including orforglipron as the only small molecule to beat oral semaglutide head to head in ACHIEVE-3, two programs killed by liver toxicity at Pfizer danuglipron and Terns TERN-601, and Structure Therapeutics aleniglipron showing the strongest weight loss at 15.3 percent placebo adjusted at 36 weeks" width="90%" >}}

The thing that makes this market so interesting is that almost every important variable is in motion at the same time: form factor (injection to pill), pricing structure ($1,000 per month to $149 to potentially lower), patent protection (expiring internationally, holding domestically), competitive dynamics (Novo decelerating, Lilly sprinting, Hims imploding), and the macro question of Medicare coverage. I'm more confident in the structural thesis, that oral GLP-1s expand the market through a Jevons-like dynamic, than I am in picking the right entry point for any individual stock. But if forced to bet on which company is best positioned for that expansion, the answer seems clear. Lilly built the molecule that doesn't need to fight the gut. Novo built one that fights and mostly loses.

The question is whether the market has already priced this in. At 30x forward earnings for Lilly and 12.5x for Novo, there's a version of this where Novo is the contrarian value play and Lilly is priced for perfection. I don't think that's the right framing. I think Novo is cheap because it has structural problems, the worst kind of cheap, and Lilly is expensive because it has structural advantages, the best kind of expensive. But I've been wrong before, and the range of analyst estimates for market size should give anyone pause about precise forecasts.

Have feedback, comments, or ideas? I'd love to hear from you.
