faq:
- question: Do green bonds actually reduce CO2 emissions?
  answer: Research using a Difference-in-Differences model on 2013-2023 bond data found no significant correlation between green bond issuance and CO2 emissions after net-zero policies were adopted. However, companies that issue only green bonds showed measurably lower CO2 emissions and higher ESG ratings, suggesting that commitment level matters more than the instrument itself.
- question: What is the green bond commitment premium?
  answer: The green bond commitment premium refers to the additional environmental and financial benefits that accrue to companies issuing exclusively green bonds. These pure-play green issuers tend to achieve higher ESG ratings, lower CO2 emissions, and lower financing costs compared to companies that mix green and conventional bonds in their debt portfolios.
- question: How can investors identify green bond greenwashing?
  answer: A strong indicator of greenwashing is when a company issues both green and conventional bonds simultaneously. Research shows these mixed-portfolio issuers achieve no measurable environmental benefits from their green bonds. Investors should favor pure-play green issuers, meaning companies whose entire bond issuance is green, as these are the ones showing genuine environmental and financial results.
- question: Do pure-play green bond issuers outperform mixed issuers?
  answer: Yes. Studies show that entities issuing only green bonds have higher ESG ratings, lower CO2 emissions, and lower financing costs. In contrast, entities issuing both green and conventional bonds show no environmental benefits at all, and in some cases exhibit higher carbon intensity than companies that issue only conventional bonds.

The difference between green finance that works and green finance that doesn't work seems to be commitment: Using a Difference-in-Differences model analyzing 2013-2023 bond data, researchers found no significant correlation between green bond issuance and CO2 emissions after net-zero policies were adopted. That's the disappointing part. On the upside: companies issuing only green bonds showed higher ESG ratings, lower CO2 emissions, and lower financing costs, achieving substantial environmental benefits and economic advantages. Meanwhile, entities issuing both conventional and green bonds showed no environmental benefits, raising concerns about potential greenwashing.

>Those issuing only green bonds tend to have higher ESG ratings, lower CO2 emissions, and lower financing costs.

This could be called the commitment premium: Companies that go all-in on green finance see real results – both environmental and financial. Those trying to have it both ways? They're essentially paying green bond premiums for conventional bond performance while fooling nobody about their environmental impact.
What are the implications for investors? We should favor pure-play green issuers, and regulators need standards that discourage this mixed-portfolio greenwashing. The study suggests current carbon reduction policies haven't created sufficient pressure on bond issuers, but perhaps the market is already creating its own incentives.
