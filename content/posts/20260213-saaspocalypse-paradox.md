faq:
- question: "What caused the February 2026 enterprise software sell-off?"
  answer: "The immediate catalyst was Anthropic releasing 11 open-source plugins for Claude Cowork on January 30, 2026, covering Legal, Sales, Marketing, Finance, and other departments. Thomson Reuters fell 16% and LegalZoom fell 20% in a single session. The broader IGV software ETF dropped 32% from its September 2025 peak to a low of $79.65, with roughly $2 trillion in market cap destroyed."
- question: "What is the BofA paradox in the software sell-off?"
  answer: "Bank of America's Vivek Arya identified a logical inconsistency: investors are simultaneously punishing hyperscaler stocks because AI capex might generate weak returns, while destroying software stocks because AI will be so pervasive it replaces all existing software. Both cannot be true. If AI tools aren't generating ROI, they're not replacing enterprise software. If they are replacing enterprise software, the hyperscalers are earning extraordinary returns."
- question: "Why does software now trade cheaper than semiconductors?"
  answer: "The Russell 1000 Software subsector trades at 32.4x forward earnings versus 43.6x for Semiconductors, an 11.2x gap that has not persisted historically. Recurring-revenue businesses with 90%+ gross margins and 95%+ renewal rates now carry a lower multiple than cyclical chipmakers with 40-60% margins and concentrated customer bases."
- question: "Which hyperscaler can fund AI capex from operating cash flow?"
  answer: "Only Microsoft generates cash from operations (net of dividends and buybacks) in excess of capital expenditure in FY2026, with roughly $110B in cash versus $105B in capex. Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Oracle are all capex-negative, with Oracle showing the widest gap at $20B cash versus $50B capex."
- question: "Is all enterprise software equally at risk from AI disruption?"
  answer: "No. The risk varies enormously by category. Deterministic, mission-critical systems (ERP, cybersecurity, observability) face low disruption risk and will likely absorb AI as additive capability. Probabilistic workflow tools (content creation, tier-1 support, basic analytics) face genuine existential risk. The market is pricing the entire software stack as if every category faces the same threat, which is a category error."
- question: "Are enterprise software earnings actually declining?"
  answer: "No. Q4 2025 earnings showed resilient or accelerating growth across major software names. ServiceNow grew subscription revenue 21%, Palantir grew 70.5%, Datadog grew 29%, and the sector is delivering 17% aggregate earnings growth in 2026. Every major name beat consensus estimates. The disconnect between fundamentals and stock prices is historically extreme."

>The market is simultaneously pricing AI capex failure and AI destroying all software. Both cannot be true.

Enterprise software just had its worst non-recessionary drawdown in over 30 years. The IGV software ETF fell roughly **32%** from its September peak to a 52-week low of **$79.65** on February 5. Almost **$2 trillion** in market cap evaporated. The RSI hit **18**, the most oversold reading [since 1990](https://articles.stockcharts.com/article/the-claude-crash-how-ai-triggered-a-historic-selloff-in-software-stocks/). Hedge funds made [$24 billion](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2026/02/04/us-software-stocks-hit-by-anthropic-wake-up-call-on-ai-disruption/) shorting the sector year-to-date. The sell-off earned its own name: SaaSpocalypse.

The immediate catalyst was Anthropic releasing [11 open-source plugins](https://github.com/anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins) for Claude Cowork on January 30. The plugins cover Legal, Sales, Marketing, Finance, Data Analysis, and several other departments. They're Apache-2.0 licensed, file-based, locally stored, and running in a macOS-only research preview with no general availability timeline. Thomson Reuters dropped **16%** in a single session, its worst day in company history. LegalZoom fell **20%**. The contagion went global: Indian IT services (TCS, Infosys, Wipro) fell 4–7%, Japanese software stocks dropped 8–11%, European services firms got caught in the downdraft. {{< img src="jpm-murphy-note-spread.png" alt="JP Morgan North America Equity Research note dated February 3 2026 by Mark R Murphy titled Software Collapse Broadens with Nowhere to Hide, arguing it feels like an illogical leap to extrapolate Claude Cowork Plugins to replacing every layer of mission-critical enterprise software" width="100%" >}}

Here is what I find interesting about this. The market is simultaneously pricing in two things that cannot both be true.

## The paradox at the center of the sell-off

[Bank of America's Vivek Arya](https://fortune.com/2026/02/04/why-saas-stocks-tech-selloff-freefall-like-deepseek-2025-overblown-paradox-irrational/) identified this paradox cleanly: investors are punishing hyperscaler stocks because AI capex might generate weak returns, while also destroying software stocks because AI adoption will be so pervasive it renders all existing software obsolete. Both cannot hold simultaneously. If AI tools aren't generating meaningful ROI for the companies building them, they're not replacing enterprise software at scale. If they are replacing enterprise software at scale, the hyperscalers are generating extraordinary returns on their infrastructure investment. Pick one. {{< img src="saaspocalypse-paradox.png" alt="Exhibit showing the BofA paradox with two mutually exclusive narratives: Narrative A that AI capex will not generate returns showing $670B capex and 4 percent coverage ratio, versus Narrative B that AI will destroy all software showing 32 percent IGV drawdown and $2 trillion market cap destroyed despite 17 percent sector earnings growth" width="90%" >}}

The numbers make this even stranger. Every major software earnings report in the past two weeks showed resilient or accelerating growth. [ServiceNow](https://newsroom.servicenow.com/press-releases/details/2026/ServiceNow-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Financial-Results-Board-of-Directors-Authorizes-Additional-5B-for-Share-Repurchase-Program/default.aspx) delivered **$3.47 billion** in Q4 subscription revenue, up 21%, beat cRPO estimates by 1.5 points, and posted a 98% renewal rate. The stock is down roughly 28% year-to-date. [Palantir](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260201154946/en/Palantir-Reports-Q4-2025-U.S.-Comm-Revenue-Growth-of-137-YY-and-Revenue-Growth-of-70-YY-Issues-FY-2026-Revenue-Guidance-of-61-YY-and-U.S.-Comm-Revenue-Guidance-of-115-YY-Crushing-Consensus-Expectations) reported **70.5%** revenue growth, U.S. commercial revenue up 137%, total contract value closed up 138%, and guided for 61% growth in 2026. It fell 11.6% on February 5 anyway. [Datadog](https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-datadog-q4-2025-posts-earnings-beat-stock-surges-93CH-4496911) posted Q4 revenue of **$953 million** at 29% growth with 31% FCF margins and was one of the only software names to bounce. Snowflake delivered [29% product revenue growth](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snowflake-snow-releases-financial-results-053947472.html) with AI revenue hitting a $100 million run rate ahead of schedule. The sector is delivering **17% aggregate earnings growth** in 2026 while trading at November 2022 EV/Sales multiples, back when the Fed was aggressively hiking into recession fears. {{< img src="earnings-vs-stock-disconnect.png" alt="Exhibit showing every major software company beating Q4 2025 earnings estimates while getting sold, with Palantir at plus 70.5 percent revenue growth but minus 11.6 percent stock, ServiceNow plus 21 percent but minus 28 percent, Oracle plus 10 percent but minus 53 percent from peak, and sector aggregate at plus 17 percent earnings growth versus minus 32 percent IGV drawdown" width="90%" >}}

I wrote [recently](https://philippdubach.com/posts/the-market-can-stay-irrational-longer-than-you-can-stay-solvent/) about how passive flows create mechanical, price-insensitive selling that overwhelms fundamental buyers. This is a textbook case. JP Morgan's Murphy [described the selling](https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/nam/en/insights/markets-and-investing/tmt/software-shock-ais-broken-logic) as driven by index arbitrage basket selling, programmatic de-grossing, cross-correlation factor contagion, and passive flow liquidity vacuums. Algorithms and index funds are selling everything with "software" in the label regardless of fundamentals. The IGV recorded its [highest single-day trading volume](https://articles.stockcharts.com/article/the-claude-crash-how-ai-triggered-a-historic-selloff-in-software-stocks/) in 25 years of existence on February 4. Software's weight in the S&P 500 shrank from **12% to 8.4%**. As JP Morgan's Toby Ogg put it: "The sector isn't just guilty until proven innocent but is now being sentenced before trial."

The Russell 1000 Software subsector now trades at **32.4x** forward earnings versus **43.6x** for semiconductors. Recurring-revenue businesses with 90%+ gross margins and 95%+ renewal rates trade at a discount to cyclical chipmakers. [Historically that's an inversion](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/jpmorgan-says-the-historic-software-selloff-has-gone-far-enough-10-stocks-to-buy-on-sale.html) that has not persisted. Individual names look even more dislocated: Adobe trades at its lowest since April 2020, erasing every penny of pandemic-era gains. Oracle has cratered **53–56%** from its highs, despite a [$523 billion cloud backlog](https://www.investing.com/analysis/oracle-selloff-tests-confidence-in-523-billion-cloud-backlog-200674345). Salesforce sits 45% below its peak while Agentforce, its agentic AI product, reached [18,500 customers](https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-avoids-q3-danger-zone-with-explosive-agentforce-momentum/) in its first year, making it the fastest-adopted organic product in company history. {{< img src="valuation-inversion.png" alt="Exhibit showing the historic valuation inversion where Russell 1000 Software at 32.4x forward PE trades below Russell 1000 Semiconductors at 43.6x, an 11.2x multiple gap, with IGV at $79.65 52-week low and S&P 500 software weight compressed from 12 percent to 8.4 percent" width="90%" >}}

## The bear case is real but mispriced in time

I want to be clear: the structural bear case for parts of the software stack is not crazy. The argument goes like this. Enterprise software monetizes through per-seat licensing. AI agents break the correlation between headcount and license count. If 10 agents do the work of 100 people, CRM seat revenue drops 90%. [AlixPartners estimates](https://www.tekedia.com/ai-could-destroy-500b-in-enterprise-software-revenue/) up to **$500 billion** in enterprise software revenue could be at risk over time. [IDC predicts](https://www.idc.com/resource-center/blog/is-saas-dead-rethinking-the-future-of-software-in-the-age-of-ai/) pure seat-based pricing will be obsolete by 2028. Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi [told TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/databricks-ceo-says-saas-isnt-dead-but-ai-will-soon-make-it-irrelevant/) that the trained-user-interface moat, software's traditional defense, collapses when the interface becomes natural language. VC has [fled traditional SaaS entirely](https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/hjlvyl7lze); as one investor noted, "an entrepreneur approaching a VC fund today with a SaaS startup won't even reach the pitch stage."

I find this thesis partially correct but wildly mispriced in its timing. There is a difference between "AI will restructure software economics over a decade" and "open-source plugins running in a macOS research preview are replacing SAP this quarter." The market is pricing the latter. [PitchBook's analysis](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/is-ais-threat-to-software-overblown-pitchbook-analysis) described replacing a core SaaS platform as "effectively open-heart surgery for an enterprise." [Gartner predicts](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-06-25-gartner-predicts-over-40-percent-of-agentic-ai-projects-will-be-canceled-by-end-of-2027) over **40%** of agentic AI projects will be cancelled by 2027 due to escalating costs and unclear ROI, and notes that only about 130 of thousands of "agentic AI vendors" are legitimate, the rest are "agent washing." The incumbents control the systems of record and the proprietary data you need to fine-tune models and ground agent outputs. That moat doesn't evaporate because someone released a Legal plugin that can draft NDAs on a laptop.

The better mental model is budget reallocation, not product replacement. [SaaStr's analysis](https://www.saastr.com/the-2026-saas-crash-its-not-what-you-think/) of Gartner's [$1.43 trillion](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2026-02-03-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-10-point-8-percent-in-2026-totaling-6-point-15-trillion-dollars) 2026 software spending forecast reveals that roughly 9 percentage points of the 14.7% headline growth is price increases on existing software, not net new demand. AI isn't eating SaaS products yet. It's eating SaaS budgets, redirecting IT spend toward infrastructure while reducing the headcount that generates software seats. That's real pressure. It's not the same as extinction.

## The capex problem nobody wants to do the math on

The capex side of this equation is where things get genuinely uncomfortable.

Combined 2026 capex guidance from Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta now sits at roughly **$650–670 billion**, more than doubling from $256 billion in 2024. Add Oracle's raised guidance of $50 billion and [you approach $700 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/google-microsoft-meta-amazon-ai-cash.html). Microsoft spent a record [**$37.5 billion** in Q2 FY2026 alone](https://fintool.com/news/microsoft-q2-record-capex-cloud-ai), up 66% year-over-year, with roughly two-thirds going to short-lived GPU/CPU assets. The trajectory is visceral: Microsoft's quarterly capex went from around **$1 billion** in early 2015 to **$30 billion** by late 2025. That is a 2,048% total increase over a decade. 

[Alphabet guided](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-plans-double-capex-spending-014548074.html) **$175–185 billion** for 2026, nearly double 2025's $91.4 billion and roughly 50% above Street expectations. Amazon guided [$200 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/amazon-amzn-q4-earnings-report-2025.html). [Meta guided](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-stock-climbs-on-q4-earnings-beat-plans-to-spend-as-much-as-135-billion-on-ai-build-out-in-2026-154456872.html) $115–135 billion. The chart below shows FY2026 estimated cash from operations (net of dividends and buybacks) versus guided capital expenditure. Only **Microsoft** comes out in the green. Every other hyperscaler is capex-negative, forcing debt issuance to cover the gap. [Oracle's deficit is the most extreme](https://www.channeldive.com/news/oracle-capex-spike-cloud-ai-data-center/807716/): roughly $20 billion in cash versus $50 billion in capex. {{< img src="hyperscaler-capex-vs-cashflow.png" alt="Exhibit showing FY2026 estimated cash from operations less dividends and buybacks versus guided capital expenditure for MSFT META GOOGL AMZN and ORCL, with only Microsoft generating a $5B surplus while Meta shows minus $23B deficit, Google minus $20B, Amazon minus $18B, and Oracle minus $30B" width="90%" >}}

[Bank of America calculates](https://fortune.com/2026/02/04/why-saas-stocks-tech-selloff-freefall-like-deepseek-2025-overblown-paradox-irrational/) that hyperscaler capex now consumes **94%** of operating cash flows after capital returns. The Big Five raised **$108 billion** in bonds in 2025 alone. AI-related services generate roughly **$25 billion** in direct revenue versus $400+ billion in annual infrastructure spending, a coverage ratio of about **4%**. That's not a return profile that destroys existing software businesses overnight. That's a return profile that needs a decade of compounding adoption to justify itself.

Here is the part that doesn't get discussed enough. [Microsoft is the only hyperscaler](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/8591224/microsoft-msft-maintains-resilient-cash-flow-amid-hyperscaler-spending-surge) that can fund this buildout from operating cash flow. Azure grew [**39%** in Q2 FY2026](https://futurumgroup.com/insights/microsoft-q2-fy-2026-cloud-surpasses-50b-azure-up-38-cc/), with cloud revenue crossing $50 billion for the first time. Microsoft is simultaneously the company best positioned to benefit from AI infrastructure spending AND the company whose products (365, Dynamics, Azure) are supposedly being disrupted by Claude plugins. The market is punishing both sides of this trade indiscriminately.

## Macro compounds but doesn't cause

The macro backdrop makes everything harder to parse. U.S. payroll growth decelerated from an average of **168,000** per month in 2024 to **49,000** in 2025. The most recent [ADP print for January 2026](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/04/adp-jobs-report-january-2026.html) showed just **22,000** private-sector jobs added. A [partial federal government shutdown](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/02/fridays-jobs-report-will-be-delayed-because-of-the-partial-government-shutdown.html) beginning February 1 delayed the BLS report. DOGE has [claimed $214 billion in estimated savings](https://doge.gov/savings) through contract and grant terminations, though [federal IT contract spending](https://www.nextgov.com/policy/2025/09/government-pacing-toward-increased-it-contract-spending-despite-doge-cuts/408002/) has actually shown surprising resilience, pacing toward $130 billion in FY2025, up from $126 billion in FY2024. Tariffs remain elevated, with [100% on imported chips and 20% on EU goods](https://www.salesforceben.com/what-do-trumps-tariffs-mean-for-the-tech-sector/). JP Morgan has raised its [global recession probability to **60%**](https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/global/en/insights/eye-on-the-market/smothering-heights-amv.pdf).

These are real headwinds. They also have nothing to do with Cowork plugins.

## Bifurcation, not extinction

So where does this leave us? I think the market is making two mistakes simultaneously.

The first is compressing a multi-year structural transition into a multi-week panic. AI agents will restructure software economics. The per-seat pricing model faces genuine pressure. But the timeline is measured in years, not weeks, and the companies that control systems of record and proprietary data have enormous advantages in the transition. Salesforce's Agentforce reaching $500 million in ARR within a year isn't the behavior of a company being disrupted, it's an incumbent absorbing the new paradigm.

The second mistake is treating the entire software stack as a monolith. The most likely outcome is bifurcation. Deterministic, mission-critical systems (ERP, core CRM, compliance, cybersecurity, observability) will absorb AI as an additive capability and likely increase their pricing power as they become the orchestration layer for agents. Probabilistic workflow tools (basic analytics dashboards, content creation, tier-1 support, simple data visualization) face genuine existential risk from general-purpose AI. The market is pricing everything like it's in the second category. {{< img src="software-bifurcation-map.png" alt="Exhibit showing a bifurcation map of software categories by AI disruption risk, with ERP cybersecurity and observability rated low risk, core CRM and dev tools rated medium risk, and content creation tier-1 support and basic analytics rated high risk, noting the market is pricing the entire stack as if every category is in the danger zone" width="90%" >}}

[Janus Henderson makes a useful distinction](https://www.janushenderson.com/en-us/investor/article/how-ai-disruption-is-reshaping-the-software-sector-landscape/) between "systems of record" and "systems of engagement." The former are deeply embedded in business processes, require regulatory compliance, and carry enormous switching costs. The latter are user-facing tools that can theoretically be replaced by an AI interface. Selling both at the same multiple compression implies the market believes switching costs, regulatory requirements, data gravity, and enterprise procurement cycles have all vanished simultaneously. That hasn't happened.

[JP Morgan's February 10 follow-up](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/jpmorgan-says-the-historic-software-selloff-has-gone-far-enough-10-stocks-to-buy-on-sale.html) argued the sell-off has gone far enough and recommended buying AI-resilient names. [BofA called the sell-off](https://fortune.com/2026/02/04/why-saas-stocks-tech-selloff-freefall-like-deepseek-2025-overblown-paradox-irrational/) a paradox that "doesn't make any sense." History suggests these kinds of extremes, the 2016 LinkedIn panic, the 2022 rate-shock drawdown, the January 2025 DeepSeek crash, tend to mark inflection points rather than starting points for further decline.

The hardest trade right now is the one that requires distinguishing between stocks that are cheap because they're broken and stocks that are cheap because the market is broken. The IGV at $80, with a 30-year-extreme RSI, pricing in an extinction event that operating results don't remotely support, looks a lot more like the latter.
