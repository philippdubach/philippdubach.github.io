---

Analysis of monetary systems, central bank policy, and geopolitical realignment, focused on structural shifts rather than cyclical noise.

The two-part [Pozsar's Bretton Woods III](/posts/pozsar-bretton-woods-framework/) series examines how commodity-backed reserve currency alternatives challenge dollar hegemony, tested against three years of subsequent data. Related macro coverage includes the [$12.6 trillion repo market](/posts/repo-might-be-even-bigger-than-we-thought/) and its opacity, Japan's [$5 trillion foreign asset position](/posts/big-in-japan/) and yen carry trade unwind risk, and [Fed dual mandate tensions](/posts/dual-mandate-tensions/) under conflicting inflation and employment signals.

The [Stewart-Thaler debate](/posts/the-stewart-thaler-debate-and-the-levels-vs-rates-problem/) dissects why the economy "feels bad" despite good headline data, connecting cumulative price levels to consumer sentiment. [Europe's payment infrastructure breakup](/posts/europes-24-trillion-payment-breakup/) tracks the structural shift from card network dominance toward sovereign account-to-account rails.

Geopolitical coverage includes the [rise of middle power realism](/posts/the-rise-of-middle-power-realism/) reshaping trade blocs and [Britain's post-Brexit strategic limbo](/posts/britains-strategic-limbo/) between US and EU spheres.
