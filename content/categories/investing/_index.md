description: "Market commentary, valuation frameworks, portfolio allocation, and investment strategy — from Buffett's legacy to prediction market microstructure."
---

Analysis of markets, valuations, and investment strategy grounded in empirical evidence rather than narrative.

Valuation coverage includes [Everything is a DCF Model](/posts/everything-is-a-dcf-model/), applying Mauboussin's framework across asset classes, and the [a16z vs AQR debate](/posts/buying-the-haystack-might-not-work-this-year/) over whether AI's trillion-dollar infrastructure bets will generate proportional returns. The [SaaSpocalypse paradox](/posts/the-saaspocalypse-paradox/) examines how the market simultaneously prices AI capex failure and software disruption.

Market structure posts cover [passive investing's structural fragility](/posts/passive-investings-active-problem/), [prediction market adverse selection](/posts/prediction-market-insider-trading/), and the [Kalshi debate](/posts/gambling-vs-investing/) over where speculation ends and investment begins.

Historical case studies include [Michael Burry's newsletter](/posts/michael-burrys-379-newsletter/) for dot-com parallels, [Buffett's retirement](/posts/praise-by-name-criticize-by-category-warren-buffett-retires-at-95/) as a case study in capital allocation, and [personal 2026 portfolio allocation](/posts/2026-portfolio-allocation/) as a worked example of thesis-driven positioning.
