Analysis of medical research and drug development, with particular depth in GLP-1 receptor agonists and metabolic medicine.

The GLP-1 coverage tracks the class from pharmacology to market impact: [oral peptide delivery challenges](/posts/the-pill-that-wastes-99-of-itself/) explains why semaglutide's 1% oral bioavailability shapes the entire competitive landscape between injectable and oral formulations, while the [Ozempic and fast food analysis](/posts/ozempic-and-the-fast-food-industry/) examines downstream demand effects on consumer industries. Emerging research on [GLP-1 for addiction treatment](/posts/glp-1-beyond-weight-loss-the-addiction-connection/) extends the receptor's relevance beyond metabolic disease.

Nobel Prize coverage in [peripheral immune tolerance](/posts/the-2025-nobel-prize-in-medicine/) explains the science behind the 2025 award, connecting regulatory T-cell mechanisms to transplant medicine and autoimmune therapy development.

Where medicine intersects with data science, posts apply quantitative methods to health data, including continuous glucose monitoring analysis and machine learning models for individual glycemic response prediction, published as formal research on SSRN.
