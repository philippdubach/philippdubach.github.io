Analysis of drug development economics and medical research, with particular depth in GLP-1 receptor agonists and the competitive dynamics between Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly.

The GLP-1 coverage tracks the class from pharmacology to market impact: [oral peptide delivery challenges](/posts/the-pill-that-wastes-99-of-itself/) explains why semaglutide's 1% oral bioavailability shapes the competitive landscape, while [Novo Nordisk's post-patent strategy](/posts/novo-nordisks-post-patent-strategy/) analyzes the amycretin pipeline against the semaglutide patent cliff. The [Ozempic and fast food analysis](/posts/ozempic-and-the-fast-food-industry/) examines downstream demand effects on consumer industries. Emerging research on [GLP-1 for addiction treatment](/posts/glp-1-beyond-weight-loss-the-addiction-connection/) extends the receptor's relevance beyond metabolic disease.

On the pharma economics side, [Isomorphic Labs and AI drug discovery](/posts/ai-can-now-design-drugs-in-seconds-we-still-cant-tell-you-if-they-work/) examines whether AI-designed drug candidates can beat the Phase II wall, and the [Novo Nordisk crash analysis](/posts/novo-was-europes-most-valuable-company/) dissects what the CagriSema trial failure and 72% drawdown mean for the GLP-1 market.

Where medicine intersects with data science, posts apply quantitative methods to health data, including continuous glucose monitoring analysis and glycemic response prediction models.
