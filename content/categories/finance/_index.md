Quantitative analysis of markets, portfolio theory, and investment strategy, grounded in data rather than narrative.

Core coverage includes [volatility drag and the variance tax](/posts/the-variance-tax/) (the ½σ² formula that governs compound returns), [the long volatility premium](/posts/the-long-volatility-premium/) as a compensated risk factor, and the structural effects of [passive investing on market dynamics](/posts/passive-investings-active-problem/). Posts on derivatives pricing examine topics like [tensor-based market modeling](/posts/beyond-monte-carlo-tensor-based-market-modeling/) as alternatives to traditional Monte Carlo simulation.

Macro-driven investment themes include [Japan's $5 trillion foreign asset position](/posts/big-in-japan/) and yen carry trade risk, [gold as tail risk insurance](/posts/damodarans-take-on-golds-2025-surge/) rather than a productive asset, and the [SaaSpocalypse paradox](/posts/the-saaspocalypse-paradox/) where software valuations collapsed despite rising AI infrastructure spend.

Applied finance coverage spans [DeFi's institutional maturity](/posts/defis-42-billion-maturity-story/), [green bond commitment premiums](/posts/the-green-bond-commitment-premium/), and the [economic game theory of Super Bowl advertising](/posts/the-economics-of-a-super-bowl-ad/). Several posts sit at the intersection of finance and AI, particularly on [LLM explainability challenges](/posts/the-model-said-so/) in regulatory contexts and machine learning approaches to derivatives pricing.

The underlying research methodology draws on options market microstructure data, published papers on SSRN, and publicly available financial datasets.
