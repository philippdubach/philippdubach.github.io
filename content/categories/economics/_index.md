Quantitative economics with emphasis on behavioral effects, simulation models, and game-theoretic analysis.

[Agent-based modeling of wealth distribution](/posts/agent-based-systems-for-modeling-wealth-distribution/) uses the Affine Wealth Model to simulate how tax policy, asset returns, and wage dispersion produce Pareto-distributed outcomes. The [behavioral economics of transit policy](/posts/behavioral-economics-transit-policy/) examines the zero price effect, where making public transport free generates disproportionate demand shifts relative to equivalent fare reductions.

Applied game theory coverage includes [Super Bowl ad economics](/posts/the-economics-of-a-super-bowl-ad/) analyzing signaling, auction dynamics, and the $7 million question of whether broadcast advertising still works.
