---

Macroeconomic analysis, behavioral economics, and geopolitical trade dynamics, with emphasis on structural shifts rather than cyclical noise.

On the quantitative side, [agent-based modeling of wealth distribution](/posts/agent-based-systems-for-modeling-wealth-distribution/) uses the Affine Wealth Model to simulate how tax policy, asset returns, and wage dispersion produce Pareto-distributed outcomes. [Stock return distributions](/posts/it-just-aint-so/) challenges the Gaussian assumption underlying standard financial models, examining fat tails and their implications for risk management.

Behavioral economics coverage includes the [zero price effect in transit policy](/posts/behavioral-economics-transit-policy/), where making public transport free generates disproportionate demand shifts relative to equivalent fare reductions. The [enterprise coordination problem](/posts/enterprise-ai-strategy-is-backwards/) applies organizational economics to explain why most corporate AI projects fail at the integration layer, not the technology layer.

Geopolitical analysis tracks [Europe's $24 trillion payment infrastructure breakup](/posts/europes-24-trillion-payment-breakup/) from Visa/Mastercard dominance toward sovereign alternatives like EPI/Wero, and the [rise of middle power realism](/posts/the-rise-of-middle-power-realism/) reshaping trade blocs. These pieces combine economic data with institutional analysis to assess which structural changes are durable versus cyclical.
