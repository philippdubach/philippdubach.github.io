description: "Engineering projects, software infrastructure, and technical deep dives — from Hugo static sites and Cloudflare Workers to computer vision and ML tutorials."

Technical implementation details, engineering projects, and hands-on tutorials aimed at practitioners.

Project work spans computer vision ([counting cards with OpenCV](/posts/counting-cards-with-computer-vision/)), machine learning ([visualizing PyTorch gradients](/posts/visualizing-gradients-with-pytorch/), [glycemic response modeling with XGBoost](/posts/modeling-glycemic-response-with-xgboost/)), health data engineering ([CGM data reader](/posts/i-built-a-cgm-data-reader/)), and AI-assisted deployment ([testing Cursor on Azure](/posts/deploying-to-production-with-ai-agents-testing-cursor-on-azure/)).

The site itself serves as a working technical case study, built with Hugo, deployed on GitHub Pages via Cloudflare, and automated with Workers for social posting, URL shortening, and analytics aggregation.
