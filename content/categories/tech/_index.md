description: "Technical deep dives on software engineering, cloud infrastructure, and developer tools — from Hugo static sites and Cloudflare Workers to AI coding assistants."
---

Technical implementation details, infrastructure analysis, and software architecture discussions aimed at practitioners.

Coverage includes the [enterprise agent stack](/posts/how-the-enterprise-ai-agent-stack-is-stratifying-in-2026/) examining how orchestration, memory, and tool-use layers are separating into distinct infrastructure tiers. The [recommendation algorithm economics](/posts/why-netflix-and-spotify-cant-afford-smarter-recommendations/) behind Netflix and Spotify analyzes why compute-optimal recommendations diverge from business-optimal ones.

Mobile platform analysis in the [State of Mobile](/posts/state-of-mobile-2026/) tracks engagement metrics, app store economics, and the convergence of social and commerce platforms. The [SaaSpocalypse paradox](/posts/the-saaspocalypse-paradox/) bridges software valuation with infrastructure economics, examining how AI capex cycles disrupt traditional SaaS pricing models.

Several posts cross into AI territory, particularly on [agentic coding benchmarks](/posts/claude-opus-4.6-anthropics-new-flagship-ai-model-for-agentic-coding/) and practical agent deployment. The site itself serves as a working technical case study, built with Hugo, deployed on GitHub Pages via Cloudflare, and automated with Workers for social posting, URL shortening, and analytics aggregation.
