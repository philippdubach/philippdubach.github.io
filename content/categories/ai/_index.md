description: "Articles on artificial intelligence, large language models, agentic systems, and machine learning research — from scaling laws and model benchmarks to practical deployment."
---

Coverage spans the full AI stack: foundational research on scaling laws and model architectures, practical deployment of LLM agents, and the business economics of enterprise AI adoption.

A recurring theme is the gap between AI benchmarks and real-world utility. Posts on [model evaluations](/posts/claude-opus-4.6-anthropics-new-flagship-ai-model-for-agentic-coding/) and [scaling law economics](/posts/the-most-expensive-assumption-in-ai/) examine whether trillion-dollar infrastructure bets translate into proportional capability gains. The [enterprise AI coordination problem](/posts/enterprise-ai-strategy-is-backwards/) argues that most organizational failures stem from integration, not model quality.

On the applied side, articles cover [sentiment-based trading signals](/posts/sentiment-trading-revisited/) using news embeddings, [diffusion model architectures](/posts/working-with-models/), and Apple's strategic positioning in LLM commoditization. The [AI and labor displacement analysis](/posts/the-reckoning-has-a-second-act/) tracks measurable job market shifts across customer support and coding, while [The Impossible Backhand](/posts/the-impossible-backhand/) examines where AI quality ceilings are making human domain expertise more valuable, not less.

Technical depth ranges from hands-on agent-building tutorials in Python to critical assessments of reasoning benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam. Where finance or economics intersect with AI, posts are cross-categorized to surface those connections.
