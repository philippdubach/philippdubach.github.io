description: "AI economics, scaling laws, enterprise strategy, labor market effects, and model evaluations — data-driven analysis of how AI creates and destroys value."
---

Coverage spans AI economics, enterprise deployment strategy, and the measurable effects of AI on labor markets and industries.

A recurring theme is the gap between AI benchmarks and real-world utility. Posts on [model evaluations](/posts/claude-opus-4.6-anthropics-new-flagship-ai-model-for-agentic-coding/) and [scaling law economics](/posts/the-most-expensive-assumption-in-ai/) examine whether trillion-dollar infrastructure bets translate into proportional capability gains. The [enterprise AI coordination problem](/posts/enterprise-ai-strategy-is-backwards/) argues that most organizational failures stem from integration, not model quality, while the [enterprise agent stack](/posts/how-the-enterprise-ai-agent-stack-is-stratifying-in-2026/) maps how orchestration, memory, and tool-use layers are separating into distinct infrastructure tiers.

On AI economics, the [OpenAI standalone P&L analysis](/posts/ai-models-as-standalone-pls/) examines unit economics at scale, and the [recommendation algorithm economics](/posts/why-netflix-and-spotify-cant-afford-smarter-recommendations/) behind Netflix and Spotify shows why compute-optimal recommendations diverge from business-optimal ones. The [a16z vs AQR AI valuation debate](/posts/buying-the-haystack-might-not-work-this-year/) tests whether current AI infrastructure spending can generate proportional returns.

The [AI and labor displacement analysis](/posts/the-reckoning-has-a-second-act/) tracks measurable job market shifts, while [The Impossible Backhand](/posts/the-impossible-backhand/) examines where AI quality ceilings make human domain expertise more valuable, not less. Applied AI work includes [sentiment-based trading signals](/posts/sentiment-trading-revisited/) using news embeddings and hands-on agent-building projects.
