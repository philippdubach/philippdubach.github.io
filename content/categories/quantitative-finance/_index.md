Data-driven analysis of financial risk, volatility, and the mathematics underlying market behavior.

Central to this category is the [variance tax](/posts/the-variance-tax/), the half-sigma-squared drag on compound returns that explains why volatility matters more than most investors realize. The companion piece on the [long volatility premium](/posts/the-long-volatility-premium/) synthesizes evidence from One River, Goldman Sachs, AQR, and Universa on whether tail hedging is a compensated factor or an expensive insurance policy.

On market structure, [It Just Ain't So](/posts/it-just-aint-so/) challenges the Gaussian assumption underlying standard financial models, examining fat tails and their implications for risk management. The [private equity beta analysis](/posts/is-private-equity-just-beta-with-a-lockup/) tests whether the illiquidity premium survives after adjusting for leverage and mark-to-market smoothing.

Applied work includes [tensor-based market modeling](/posts/beyond-monte-carlo-tensor-based-market-modeling/) as an alternative to Monte Carlo simulation, and the [mathematics of provably fair casino games](/posts/against-all-odds-the-mathematics-of-provably-fair-casino-games/) applying probability theory to verifiable randomness.
