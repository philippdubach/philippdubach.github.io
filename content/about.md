I started this site in 2024 as a simple way to collect interesting articles and papers that catch my attention. Each post includes a link, title, and my brief commentary or summary. I also share personal quantitative finance and data science projects.

This collection helps me maintain a personal repository of articles and papers, practice my writing through short summaries, and motivate myself to complete personal projects by sharing them in a structured way. The opinions expressed under this domain are my own and do not reflect the view of my employer, sponsors or clients.

The website runs on Hugo and is hosted on GitHub Pages. For details on how the site is built, see [The Tech behind this Site](/posts/the-tech-behind-this-site/).
