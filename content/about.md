I started this link blog in 2023 as a simple way to collect interesting articles and papers that catch my attention. Each post includes a link, title, and my brief commentary or summary.

This project serves three purposes for me: creating a personal repository articles and papers, practicing active reading through writing short summaries, and motivating myself to complete small weekend projects by sharing them in a structured way.

The site runs on Hugo and is hosted on GitHub Pages.
