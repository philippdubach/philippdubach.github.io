This site started in 2024 as a way to collect articles and papers that catch my attention. Each post includes a link, title, and my brief commentary. I also share personal projects in quantitative finance and data science.

Writing here helps me maintain a personal repository, practice [articulating ideas](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44222-025-00323-4), and complete projects by sharing them publicly. 

The opinions expressed are my own and do not reflect the views of any employer, sponsors, or clients.

The website runs on Hugo and is hosted on GitHub Pages. For details on how the site is built, see [the tech behind this site](/posts/the-tech-behind-this-site/).
