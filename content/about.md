I started this site in 2024 as a simple way to collect interesting articles and papers that catch my attention. Each post includes a link, title, and my brief commentary or summary. I also share personal quantitative finance and data science projects.

This collection helps me maintain a personal repository of articles and papers, practice my writing through short summaries, and motivate myself to complete personal projects by sharing them in a structured way. The opinions expressed under this domain are my own and do not reflect the view of my employer, sponsors or clients.

The website [runs on Hugo](/2024/01/15/the-tech-behind-this-site/) and is hosted on GitHub Pages.
