&lt;p>the agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal, understands your codebase, and helps you code faster through natural language commands&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I was looking for a task to test its abilities. Fairly quickly we wrote &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/philippdubach/741cbd56498e43375892966ca691b9c2">less than 200 lines of python code predicting black jack odds&lt;/a> using Monte Carlo Simulation. When I went on to test this little tool on &lt;a href="https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack">Washington Post&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a> online Black Jack (I also didn&amp;rsquo;t know that existed!) I quickly noticed how impractical it was to manually input all the card values on the table manually. What if the tool would also automatically recognize the cards that are on the table and calculate the odds from it? I have never done anything with computer vision so this seemed like a good challenge.

To get to any reasonable result we have to start with classification where we &amp;ldquo;teach&amp;rdquo; the model to categorize data by showing them lots of examples with correct labels. But where do the labels come from? I manually annotated &lt;a href="https://universe.roboflow.com/cards-agurd/playing_card_classification">409 playing cards across 117 images&lt;/a> using Roboflow Annotate (at first I only did half as much - why this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good idea we&amp;rsquo;ll see in a minute). Once enough screenshots of cards were annotated we can train the model to recognize the cards and predict card values on tables it has never seen before. I was able to use a &lt;a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-t4/">NVIDIA T4 GPU&lt;/a> inside Google Colab which offers some GPU time for free when capacity is available.

During training, the algorithm learns patterns from this example data, adjusting its internal parameters millions of times until it gets really good at recognizing the differences between categories (in this case different cards). Once trained, the model can then make predictions on new, unseen data by applying the patterns it learned. With the annotated dataset ready, it was time to implement the actual computer vision model. I chose to run inference on &lt;a href="https://docs.ultralytics.com/de/models/yolo11/">Ultralytics&amp;rsquo; YOLOv11&lt;/a> pre-trained model, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. I set up the environment in Google Colab following the &lt;a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/train-yolo11-object-detection-on-custom-dataset.ipynb">&amp;ldquo;How to Train YOLO11 Object Detection on a Custom Dataset&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> notebook. After extracting the annotated dataset from Roboflow, I began training the model using the pre-trained YOLOv11s weights as a starting point. This approach, called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning">transfer learning&lt;/a>, allows the model to leverage patterns already learned from millions of general images and adapt them to this specific task.
I initially set it up to &lt;a href="https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/model-training-tips/#other-techniques-to-consider-when-handling-a-large-dataset">run for 350 epochs&lt;/a>, though the model&amp;rsquo;s built-in early stopping mechanism kicked in after 242 epochs when no improvement was observed for 100 consecutive epochs. The best results were achieved at epoch 142, taking around 13 minutes to complete on the Tesla T4 GPU.
The initial results were quite promising, with an overall mean Average Precision (mAP) of 80.5% at IoU threshold 0.5. Most individual card classes achieved good precision and recall scores, with only a few cards like the 6 and Queen showing slightly lower precision values.

However, looking at the confusion matrix and loss curves revealed some interesting patterns. While the model was learning effectively (as shown by the steadily decreasing loss), there were still some misclassifications between similar cards, particularly among the numbered cards. This highlighted exactly why I mentioned earlier that annotating only half the amount of data initially &amp;ldquo;wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good idea&amp;rdquo; - more training examples would likely improve these edge cases and reduce confusion between similar-looking cards. My first attempt at solving the remaining accuracy issues was to add another layer to the workflow by sending the detected cards to Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s Claude API for additional OCR processing.

This hybrid approach was very effective - the combination of YOLO&amp;rsquo;s object detection to dynamically crop down the Black Jack table to individual cards with Claude&amp;rsquo;s advanced vision capabilities yielded 99.9% accuracy on the predicted cards. However, this solution came with a significant drawback: the additional API layer consumed valuable time and the large model&amp;rsquo;s processing overhead, making it impractical for real-time gameplay.
Seeking a faster solution, I implemented the same workflow &lt;a href="https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR">locally using easyOCR&lt;/a> instead. EasyOCR seems to be really good at extracting black text on white background but &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68261703/how-to-improve-accuracy-prediction-for-easyocr">might struggle with everything else&lt;/a>. While it was able to correctly identify the card numbers when it detected them, it struggled to recognize around half of the cards in the first place - even when fed pre-cropped card images directly from the YOLO model. This inconsistency made it unreliable for the application.
Rather than continue band-aid solutions, I decided to go back and improve my dataset. I doubled the training data by adding another 60 screenshots with the same train/test split as before. More importantly, I went through all the previous annotations and fixed many of the bounding polygons. I noticed that several misidentifications were caused by the model detecting face-down dealer cards as valid cards, which happened because some annotations for face-up cards inadvertently included parts of the card backs next to them. The improved dataset and cleaned annotations delivered what I was hoping for: The confusion matrix now shows a much cleaner diagonal pattern, indicating that the model now correctly identifies most cards without the cross-contamination issues we saw earlier.

Both the training and validation losses converge smoothly without signs of overfitting, while the precision and recall metrics climb steadily to plateau near perfect scores. The mAP@50 reaches an impressive 99.5%. Most significantly, the confusion matrix now shows that the model has virtually eliminated false positives with background elements. The &amp;ldquo;background&amp;rdquo; column (rightmost) in the confusion matrix is now much cleaner, with only minimal misclassifications of actual cards as background noise.

With the model trained and performing, it was time to deploy it and play some blackjack. Initially, I tested the system using &lt;a href="https://docs.roboflow.com/deploy/serverless-hosted-api-v2">Roboflow&amp;rsquo;s hosted API&lt;/a>, which took around 4 seconds per inference - far too slow for practical gameplay. However, running the model locally on my laptop dramatically improved performance, achieving inference times of less than 0.1 seconds per image (1.3ms preprocess, 45.5ms inference, 0.4ms postprocess per image). I then &lt;a href="https://python-mss.readthedocs.io/">integrated the model with MSS&lt;/a> to capture a real-time feed of my browser window. The system automatically overlays the detected cards with their predicted values and confidence scores

The final implementation successfully combines the pieces: the computer vision model detects and identifies cards in real-time, feeds this information to the Monte Carlo simulation, and displays both the card recognition results and the calculated odds directly on screen - do not try this at your local (online) casino!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NVIDIA Likes Small Language Models</title><link>http://localhost:1313/2025/07/04/nvidia-likes-small-language-models/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/2025/07/04/nvidia-likes-small-language-models/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A Small Language Model (SLM) is a LM that can fit onto a common consumer electronic device and perform inference with latency sufficiently low to be practical when serving the agentic requests of one user. [&amp;hellip;] We note that as of 2025, we would be comfortable with considering most models below 10bn parameters in size to be SLMs.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/slm-agents/">(NVIDIA) researchers&lt;/a> argue that most agentic applications perform repetitive, specialized tasks that don&amp;rsquo;t require the full generalist capabilities of LLMs. They propose heterogeneous agentic systems where SLMs handle most tasks while LLMs are used selectively for complex reasoning. They present three main arguments: (1) SLMs are sufficiently powerful for agentic tasks, as demonstrated by recent models like &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/phi">Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Phi series&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://research.nvidia.com/labs/adlr/nemotronh/">NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s Nemotron-H family&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/HuggingFaceTB/smollm2-6723884218bcda64b34d7db9">Hugging Face&amp;rsquo;s SmolLM2 series&lt;/a>, which achieve comparable performance to much larger models &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05465">while being 10-30x more efficient&lt;/a>. (2) SLMs are inherently more operationally suitable for agentic systems due to their faster inference, lower latency, and ability to run on edge devices. (3) SLMs are necessarily more economical, offering significant cost savings in inference, fine-tuning, and deployment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Novo Nordisk's Post-Patent Strategy</title><link>http://localhost:1313/2025/06/29/novo-nordisks-post-patent-strategy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/2025/06/29/novo-nordisks-post-patent-strategy/</guid><description>&lt;p>Novo Nordisk, a long time member of my &amp;ldquo;regrets&amp;rdquo; stock list, has become &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVO/chart/">reasonably affordable lately (-48% yoy)&lt;/a>.

For simple problems, standard models actually outperform reasoning models while being more token-efficient. At medium complexity, reasoning models show their advantage. But at high complexity? Both collapse completely.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the kicker: reasoning models exhibit counterintuitive scaling behavior—their thinking effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines despite having adequate token budget.

Since I was already logging my macronutrients and learning more about molecular biology in an &lt;a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-7-008-7-28x-molecular-biology/">MIT MOOC&lt;/a> I became curious if given a meal&amp;rsquo;s macronutrients (carbs, protein, fat) and some basic individual characteristics (age, BMI), these could serve as features in a regressor machine learning model to predict the curve parameters of the postprandial glucose curve (how my blood sugar levels change after eating). I came across a paper on &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)01481-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867415014816%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">Personalized Nutrition by Prediction of Glycemic Responses&lt;/a> which did exactly that. Unfortunately, neither the data nor the code were publicly available. And - I wanted to predict my &lt;em>own&lt;/em> glycemic response curve. So I decided to build my own model.

The paper represents an exercise in applying machine learning techniques to medical applications. The methodologies employed were largely inspired by &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)01481-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867415014816%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">Zeevi et al.&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s approach. I quickly realized that training a model on my own data &lt;em>only&lt;/em> was not very promising if not impossible. To tackle this, I used the publicly available &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005143">Hall dataset&lt;/a> containing continuous glucose monitoring data from 57 adults, which I narrowed down to 112 standardized meals from 19 non-diabetic subjects with their respective glucose curve after the meal (full methodology in the paper).

Rather than trying to predict the entire glucose curve, I simplified the problem by fitting each postprandial response to a normalized Gaussian function. This gave me three key parameters to predict: amplitude (how high glucose rises), time-to-peak (when it peaks), and curve width (how long the response lasts).

The Gaussian approximation worked surprisingly well for characterizing most glucose responses. While some curves fit better than others, the majority of postprandial responses were well-captured, though there&amp;rsquo;s clear variation between individuals and meals. Some responses were high amplitude, narrow width, while others are more gradual and prolonged.

I then trained an XGBoost regressor with 27 engineered features including meal composition, participant characteristics, and interaction terms. XGBoost was chosen for its ability to handle mixed data types, built-in feature importance, and strong performance on tabular data. The pipeline included hyperparameter tuning with 5-fold cross-validation to optimize learning rate, tree depth, and regularization parameters. Rather than relying solely on basic meal macronutrients, I engineered features across multiple categories and implemented CGM statistical features calculated over different time windows (24-hour and 4-hour periods), including time-in-range and glucose variability metrics. Architecture wise, I trained three separate XGBoost regressors - one for each Gaussian parameter.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Model Said So</title><link>http://localhost:1313/2025/05/28/the-model-said-so/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/2025/05/28/the-model-said-so/</guid><description>&lt;p>LLMs make your life easier until they don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>

Layer 2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum now dominate the scaling landscape, while zero-knowledge proofs have reduced compliance costs by 30%. Even the terminology is evolving—researchers now discuss &amp;ldquo;Total Value Redeemable&amp;rdquo; instead of the traditional TVL metric, acknowledging that not all locked value is immediately liquid.

Cross-chain bridges remain &amp;ldquo;high-risk attack targets,&amp;rdquo; a sobering reminder that connecting different blockchains is still more art than science.

&lt;p>As we were looking for new investment strategies for our Macro Sentiment Trading team, OpenAI had just published their &lt;a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5-turbo">GPT-3.5 Model&lt;/a>. After first experiments with the model, we asked ourselves: How would large language models like GPT-3.5 perform in predicting sentiment in financial markets, where the signal-to-noise ratio is notoriously low? And could they potentially even outperform industry benchmarks at interpreting market sentiment from news headlines? The idea wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely new. &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3389884">Studies&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1702854">[2]&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=685145">[3]&lt;/a> have shown that investor sentiment, extracted from news and social media, can forecast market movements. But most approaches rely on traditional NLP models or proprietary systems like &lt;a href="https://www.ravenpack.com">RavenPack&lt;/a>. With the recent advances in large language models, I wanted to test whether these more sophisticated models could provide a competitive edge in sentiment-based trading. Before looking at model selection, it&amp;rsquo;s worth understanding what makes trading on sentiment so challenging. News headlines present two fundamental problems that any robust system must address.

First, headlines are inherently non-stationary. Unlike other data sources, news reflects the constantly shifting landscape of global events, political climates, economic trends, etc. A model trained on COVID-19 vaccine headlines from 2020 might struggle with geopolitical tensions in 2023. This temporal drift means algorithms must be adaptive to maintain relevance.

Second, the relationship between headlines and market impact is far from obvious. Consider these actual headlines from November 2020: &amp;ldquo;Pfizer Vaccine Prevents 90% of COVID Infections&amp;rdquo; drove the S&amp;amp;P 500 up 1.85%, while &amp;ldquo;Pfizer Says Safety Milestone Achieved&amp;rdquo; barely moved the market at -0.05%. The same company, similar positive news, dramatically different market reactions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Passive Investing's Active Problem</title><link>http://localhost:1313/2025/02/15/passive-investings-active-problem/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/2025/02/15/passive-investings-active-problem/</guid><description>&lt;p>(1) A new academic paper suggests the rise of passive investing may be fueling fragile market moves.

That&amp;rsquo;s the disappointing part. On the upside: companies issuing only green bonds showed higher ESG ratings, lower CO2 emissions, and lower financing costs, achieving substantial environmental benefits and economic advantages. Meanwhile, entities issuing both conventional and green bonds showed no environmental benefits, raising concerns about potential greenwashing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Crypto Mean Reversion Trading</title><link>http://localhost:1313/2024/11/11/crypto-mean-reversion-trading/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/2024/11/11/crypto-mean-reversion-trading/</guid><description>&lt;p>In late 2021, Lars Kaiser&amp;rsquo;s paper on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1544612318304513">seasonality in cryptocurrencies&lt;/a> inspired me to use my &lt;a href="https://docs.kraken.com/api/">Kraken API Key&lt;/a> to try and make some money. A quick summary of the paper: (1) Kaiser analyzes seasonality patterns across 10 cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.), examining returns, volatility, trading volume, and spreads (2) Finds no consistent calendar effects in cryptocurrency returns, supporting weak-form market efficiency (3) Observes robust patterns in trading activity - lower volume, volatility, and spreads in January, weekends, and summer months (4) Documents significant impact of January 2018 market sell-off on seasonality patterns (5) Reports a &amp;ldquo;reverse Monday effect&amp;rdquo; for Bitcoin (positive Monday returns) and &amp;ldquo;reverse January effect&amp;rdquo; (negative January returns) (6) Trading activity patterns suggest crypto markets are dominated by retail rather than institutional investors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI Learns Economics Like Undergrads</title><link>http://localhost:1313/2024/11/01/ai-learns-economics-like-undergrads/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/2024/11/01/ai-learns-economics-like-undergrads/</guid><description>&lt;p>This cuts to the heart of how LLMs actually work: Testing Large Language Models on economics problems reveals that these supposedly sophisticated systems don&amp;rsquo;t just learn correct reasoning—they absorb our misconceptions too. The study found LLMs performing reasonably well on undergraduate economics questions (around 65% accuracy) but falling flat on graduate-level problems (35% accuracy). More tellingly, the specific errors weren&amp;rsquo;t random failures but systematic mistakes that mirror exactly what human students get wrong.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Meta's Edge AI Gambit</title><link>http://localhost:1313/2024/09/28/metas-edge-ai-gambit/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/2024/09/28/metas-edge-ai-gambit/</guid><description>&lt;p>While the AI industry obsesses over ever-larger cloud models, Meta just made a somewhat contrarian bet with Llama 3.2. Instead of chasing GPT-4 with another massive, they&amp;rsquo;re going small and local — releasing lightweight AI models designed to run entirely on your phone. The technical achievement is genuinely impressive: vision-capable models that can analyze images and text, plus compact versions that &amp;ldquo;fit in as little as 1GB of memory.&amp;rdquo; But the real story might be more strategic. Meta is essentially arguing that the future of AI isn&amp;rsquo;t in OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s cloud-centric paradigm, but in edge computing where your data never leaves your device.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Some Active Funds Create Their Own Returns</title><link>http://localhost:1313/2024/06/21/how-some-active-funds-create-their-own-returns/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/2024/06/21/how-some-active-funds-create-their-own-returns/</guid><description>&lt;p>(1) Many active funds hold concentrated portfolios. Flow-driven trading in these securities causes price pressure, which pushes up the funds&amp;rsquo; existing positions resulting in realized returns.
(2) The researchers decomposes fund returns into a price pressure (self-inflated) and a fundamental component and show that when allocating capital across funds, investors are unable to identify whether realized returns are self-inflated or fundamental.
(3) Because investors chase self-inflated fund returns at a high frequency, even short-lived impact meaningfully affects fund flows at longer time scales.
(4) The combination of price impact and return chasing causes an endogenous feedback loop and a reallocation of wealth to early fund investors, which unravels once the price pressure reverts.
(5) The researchers find that flows chasing self-inflated returns predict bubbles in ETFs and their subsequent crashes, and lead to a daily wealth reallocation of 500 Million from ETFs alone.
(6) Around 2% of all daily flows and 8-12% of flows in the top decile of illiquid funds can be attributed to &amp;ldquo;Ponzi flows&amp;rdquo;. The researcher estimate that every day around $500 Million of investor wealth is reallocated because of the price impact of Ponzi flows.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OpenAI Cuts Prices, Raises Stakes</title><link>http://localhost:1313/2024/05/20/openai-cuts-prices-raises-stakes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/2024/05/20/openai-cuts-prices-raises-stakes/</guid><description>&lt;p>OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s GPT-4o launch is a classic Silicon Valley competitive strategy disguised as a product announcement.&lt;/p>
