        <p>This cuts to the heart of how LLMs actually work: Testing Large Language Models on economics problems reveals that these supposedly sophisticated systems don&rsquo;t just learn correct reasoning—they absorb our misconceptions too. The study found LLMs performing reasonably well on undergraduate economics questions (around 65% accuracy) but falling flat on graduate-level problems (35% accuracy). More tellingly, the specific errors weren&rsquo;t random failures but systematic mistakes that mirror exactly what human students get wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Interestingly, the errors made by LLMs often mirror those made by human students, suggesting that these models may have learned not just correct economic reasoning but also common misconceptions.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Which kind of makes sense when we understand how language models actually work: They&rsquo;re not reasoning through economic principles—they&rsquo;re pattern-matching against their training data, which includes millions of wrong answers, confused explanations, and half-understood concepts scattered across the internet.</p>
<p>What are the practical implications? If you&rsquo;re using AI for financial analysis or economic modeling, you&rsquo;re essentially getting a very confident undergraduate who&rsquo;s memorized a lot of material but fundamentally doesn&rsquo;t understand when to apply which concepts. The models particularly struggled with dynamic optimization and game theory—exactly the areas where getting it wrong costs real money. Perhaps most unsettling: chain-of-thought prompting barely helped. Even when asked to show their work, the models maintained their confident confusion, just with more elaborate explanations of why 2+2 equals 5.</p>
