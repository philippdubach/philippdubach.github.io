        <p>(1) Many active funds hold concentrated portfolios. Flow-driven trading in these securities causes price pressure, which pushes up the funds&rsquo; existing positions resulting in realized returns.
(2) The researchers decomposes fund returns into a price pressure (self-inflated) and a fundamental component and show that when allocating capital across funds, investors are unable to identify whether realized returns are self-inflated or fundamental.
(3) Because investors chase self-inflated fund returns at a high frequency, even short-lived impact meaningfully affects fund flows at longer time scales.
(4) The combination of price impact and return chasing causes an endogenous feedback loop and a reallocation of wealth to early fund investors, which unravels once the price pressure reverts.
(5) The researchers find that flows chasing self-inflated returns predict bubbles in ETFs and their subsequent crashes, and lead to a daily wealth reallocation of 500 Million from ETFs alone.
(6) Around 2% of all daily flows and 8-12% of flows in the top decile of illiquid funds can be attributed to &ldquo;Ponzi flows&rdquo;. The researcher estimate that every day around $500 Million of investor wealth is reallocated because of the price impact of Ponzi flows.</p>
<p>In active funds  investors are unable to identify whether realized returns are self-inflated or fundamental. Here&rsquo;s how the magic trick works: Many active funds hold concentrated portfolios. Flow-driven trading in these securities causes price pressure, which pushes up the funds&rsquo; existing positions resulting in realized returns.
The mechanism is as follows: Fund managers pick concentrated positions, new money flows in, that money pushes up prices of the fund&rsquo;s existing holdings, creating impressive returns that attract more money, which pushes prices higher still. As the researchers put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Via their own price impact, active funds effectively reallocate capital from late to early investors.</p></blockquote>
<p>The numbers are staggering. Around 2% of all daily flows and 8-12% of flows in the top decile of illiquid funds can be attributed to Ponzi flows, with around $500 Million of investor wealth reallocated daily because of this price impact. Even more striking: funds with high Ponzi flows experience subsequent drawdowns of over 200%.
This isn&rsquo;t just academic theorizing—flows chasing self-inflated returns predict bubbles in ETFs and their subsequent crashes. The researchers propose a simple fix: a fund illiquidity measure that captures a fund&rsquo;s potential for self-inflated returns.</p>
