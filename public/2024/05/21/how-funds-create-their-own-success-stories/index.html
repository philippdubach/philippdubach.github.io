        <p>Paper Summary</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Many active funds hold concentrated portfolios. Flow-driven trading in these securities causes price pressure, which pushes up the funds&rsquo; existing positions resulting in realized returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The researchers decomposes fund returns into a price pressure (self-inflated) and a fundamental component and show that when allocating capital across funds, investors are unable to identify whether realized returns are self-inflated or fundamental.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because investors chase self-inflated fund returns at a high frequency, even short-lived impact meaningfully affects fund flows at longer time scales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The combination of price impact and return chasing causes an endogenous feedback loop and a reallocation of wealth to early fund investors, which unravels once the price pressure reverts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The researchers find that flows chasing self-inflated returns predict bubbles in ETFs and their subsequent crashes, and lead to a daily wealth reallocation of 500 Million from ETFs alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Around 2% of all daily flows and 8-12% of flows in the top decile of illiquid funds can be attributed to Ponzi flows. We estimate that every day around $500 Million of investor wealth is reallocated because of the price impact of Ponzi flows.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Every day, half a billion dollars gets quietly reshuffled between investors through what researchers are calling &ldquo;Ponzi Funds&rdquo;—these aren&rsquo;t literal Ponzi schemes. In active funds  investors are unable to identify whether realized returns are self-inflated or fundamental. Here&rsquo;s how the magic trick works: Many active funds hold concentrated portfolios. Flow-driven trading in these securities causes price pressure, which pushes up the funds&rsquo; existing positions resulting in realized returns.
The mechanism is elegantly perverse. Fund managers pick concentrated positions, new money flows in, that money pushes up prices of the fund&rsquo;s existing holdings, creating impressive returns that attract more money, which pushes prices higher still. As the researchers put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Via their own price impact, active funds effectively reallocate capital from late to early investors.</p></blockquote>
<p>The numbers are staggering. Around 2% of all daily flows and 8-12% of flows in the top decile of illiquid funds can be attributed to &ldquo;Ponzi flows&rdquo;, with around $500 Million of investor wealth reallocated daily because of this price impact. Even more striking: funds with high Ponzi flows experience subsequent drawdowns of over 200%.
This isn&rsquo;t just academic theorizing—flows chasing self-inflated returns predict bubbles in ETFs and their subsequent crashes. The researchers propose a simple fix: a fund illiquidity measure that captures a fund&rsquo;s potential for self-inflated returns.
The deeper question this raises is unsettling: if professional investors can&rsquo;t distinguish between genuine alpha and price pressure artifacts, what does that say about market efficiency? Sometimes the most dangerous illusions are the ones hiding in plain sight.</p>
