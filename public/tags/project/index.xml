Since I was already logging my macronutrients and learning more about molecular biology in an &lt;a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-7-008-7-28x-molecular-biology/">MIT MOOC&lt;/a> I became curious if given a meal&amp;rsquo;s macronutrients (carbs, protein, fat) and some basic individual characteristics (age, BMI), these could serve as features in a regressor machine learning model to predict the curve parameters of the postprandial glucose curve (how my blood sugar levels change after eating). I came across a paper on &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)01481-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867415014816%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">Personalized Nutrition by Prediction of Glycemic Responses&lt;/a> which did exactly that. Unfortunately, neither the data nor the code were publicly available. And - I wanted to predict my &lt;em>own&lt;/em> glycemic response curve. So I decided to build my own model. In the process I wrote this &lt;a href="https://static.philippdubach.com/pdf/Modeling_Postprandial_Glycemic_Response_in_Non_Diabetic_Adults_Using_XGBRegressor.pdf">working paper&lt;/a>.

The paper represents an exercise in applying machine learning techniques to medical applications. The methodologies employed were largely inspired by &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)01481-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867415014816%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">Zeevi et al.&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s approach. I quickly realized that training a model on my own data &lt;em>only&lt;/em> was not very promising if not impossible. To tackle this, I used the publicly available &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005143">Hall dataset&lt;/a> containing continuous glucose monitoring data from 57 adults, which I narrowed down to 112 standardized meals from 19 non-diabetic subjects with their respective glucose curve after the meal (full methodology in the paper).

Rather than trying to predict the entire glucose curve, I simplified the problem by fitting each postprandial response to a normalized Gaussian function. This gave me three key parameters to predict: amplitude (how high glucose rises), time-to-peak (when it peaks), and curve width (how long the response lasts).

The Gaussian approximation worked surprisingly well for characterizing most glucose responses. While some curves fit better than others, the majority of postprandial responses were well-captured, though there&amp;rsquo;s clear variation between individuals and meals. Some responses were high amplitude, narrow width, while others are more gradual and prolonged.

I then trained an XGBoost regressor with 27 engineered features including meal composition, participant characteristics, and interaction terms. XGBoost was chosen for its ability to handle mixed data types, built-in feature importance, and strong performance on tabular data. The pipeline included hyperparameter tuning with 5-fold cross-validation to optimize learning rate, tree depth, and regularization parameters. Rather than relying solely on basic meal macronutrients, I engineered features across multiple categories and implemented CGM statistical features calculated over different time windows (24-hour and 4-hour periods), including time-in-range and glucose variability metrics. Architecture wise, I trained three separate XGBoost regressors - one for each Gaussian parameter.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Trading on Market Sentiment</title><link>http://localhost:1313/2025/02/20/trading-on-market-sentiment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/2025/02/20/trading-on-market-sentiment/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This post is based in part on a 2022 presentation I gave for the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3bd45acd-b323-3c6b-ba98-ac78b456f308">ICBS Student Investment Fund&lt;/a> and my seminar work at Imperial College London.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As we were looking for new investment strategies for our Macro Sentiment Trading team, OpenAI had just published their &lt;a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5-turbo">GPT-3.5 Model&lt;/a>. After first experiments with the model, we asked ourselves: How would large language models like GPT-3.5 perform in predicting sentiment in financial markets, where the signal-to-noise ratio is notoriously low? And could they potentially even outperform industry benchmarks at interpreting market sentiment from news headlines? The idea wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely new. &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3389884">Studies&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1702854">[2]&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=685145">[3]&lt;/a> have shown that investor sentiment, extracted from news and social media, can forecast market movements. But most approaches rely on traditional NLP models or proprietary systems like &lt;a href="https://www.ravenpack.com">RavenPack&lt;/a>. With the recent advances in large language models, I wanted to test whether these more sophisticated models could provide a competitive edge in sentiment-based trading. Before looking at model selection, it&amp;rsquo;s worth understanding what makes trading on sentiment so challenging. News headlines present two fundamental problems that any robust system must address.

First, headlines are inherently non-stationary. Unlike other data sources, news reflects the constantly shifting landscape of global events, political climates, economic trends, etc. A model trained on COVID-19 vaccine headlines from 2020 might struggle with geopolitical tensions in 2023. This temporal drift means algorithms must be adaptive to maintain relevance.

Second, the relationship between headlines and market impact is far from obvious. Consider these actual headlines from November 2020: &amp;ldquo;Pfizer Vaccine Prevents 90% of COVID Infections&amp;rdquo; drove the S&amp;amp;P 500 up 1.85%, while &amp;ldquo;Pfizer Says Safety Milestone Achieved&amp;rdquo; barely moved the market at -0.05%.
