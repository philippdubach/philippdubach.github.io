Since I was already logging my macronutrients a learning more about molecular biology in an &lt;a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-7-008-7-28x-molecular-biology/">MIT MOOC&lt;/a> I became curious if given a meal&amp;rsquo;s macronutrients (carbs, protein, fat) and some basic individual characteristics (age, BMI) could serve as features in a regressor machine learning model to predict the curve parameters of the postprandial glucose curve (how my blood sugar levels change after eating). I came across &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)01481-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867415014816%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">Personalized Nutrition by Prediction of Glycemic Responses&lt;/a> which did exactly that. Yet neither the data nor the code was publicly available. And - I wanted to predict my &lt;em>own&lt;/em> glycemic response curve. So I decided to build my own model. In the process I wrote this &lt;a href="https://static.philippdubach.com/pdf/Modeling_Postprandial_Glycemic_Response_in_Non_Diabetic_Adults_Using_XGBRegressor.pdf">working paper&lt;/a>.

The paper represents an exercise in applying machine learning techniques to medical applications. The methodologies employed were largely inspired by &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)01481-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867415014816%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">Zeevi et al.&lt;/a>â€™s approach. I quickly realized that training a model on my own data &lt;em>only&lt;/em> was not very promising if not impossible. To tackle this, I used the publicly available &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005143">Hall dataset&lt;/a> containing continuous glucose monitoring data from 57 adults, which I narrowed down to 112 standardized meals from 19 non-diabetic subjects with their respective glucose curve after the meal (full methodology in the paper).

Rather than trying to predict the entire glucose curve, I simplified the problem by fitting each postprandial response to a normalized Gaussian function. This gave me three key parameters to predict: amplitude (how high glucose rises), time-to-peak (when it peaks), and curve width (how long the response lasts).

The Gaussian approximation worked surprisingly well for characterizing most glucose responses. While some curves fit better than others the majority of postprandial responses were well-captured, though there&amp;rsquo;s clear variation between individuals and meals. Some responses are high amplitude, narrow width, while others are more gradual and prolonged.

I then trained an XGBoost regressor with 27 engineered features including meal composition, participant characteristics, and interaction terms. XGBoost was chosen for its ability to handle mixed data types, built-in feature importance, and strong performance on tabular data. The pipeline included hyperparameter tuning with 5-fold cross-validation to optimize learning rate, tree depth, and regularization parameters. Rather than relying solely on basic meal macronutrients, I engineered features across multiple categories and implemented CGM statistical features calculated over different time windows (24-hour and 4-hour periods), including time-in-range and glucose variability metrics. Architecture wise I trained three separate XGBoost regressors - one for each Gaussian parameter.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I Built a CGM Data Reader</title><link>http://localhost:1313/2025/01/02/i-built-a-cgm-data-reader/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/2025/01/02/i-built-a-cgm-data-reader/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last year I put a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) sensor, specifically the &lt;a href="https://www.freestyle.abbott">Abbott Freestyle Libre 3&lt;/a>, on my left arm.

Unfortunately, Abbott&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/freestyle-librelink-us/id1325992472">FreeStyle LibreLink&lt;/a> app is less than optimal (3,250 other people with an average rating of 2.9/5.0 seem to agree). To their defense, the web app LibreView does offer some nice reports which can be generated as PDFsâ€”not very dynamic, but still something! What I had in mind was more in the fashion of the &lt;a href="https://ultrahuman.com/m1">Ultrahuman M1 dashboard&lt;/a>. Unfortunately, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t allowed to use my Libre sensor (EU firmware) with their app (yes, I spoke to customer service).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My First 'Optimal' Portfolio</title><link>http://localhost:1313/2024/03/15/my-first-optimal-portfolio/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/2024/03/15/my-first-optimal-portfolio/</guid><description>&lt;p>My introduction to quantitative portfolio optimization happened during my undergraduate years, inspired by Attilio Meucci&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-27904-4">Risk and Asset Allocation&lt;/a> and the convex optimization &lt;a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/teaching.html">teachings of Diamond and Boyd at Stanford&lt;/a>.
