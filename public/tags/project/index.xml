Inspired by Meucci&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-27904-4">Risk and Asset Allocation&lt;/a> as well as Diamond and Boyd&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/teaching.html">Stanford teaching on Convex Optimization&lt;/a> I set out to build my first &amp;ldquo;optimal&amp;rdquo; portfolio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With a healthy dose of home bias, I developed what would eventually be published as &lt;a href="https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24351">A Python integration of practical asset allocation based on modern portfolio theory and its advancements&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What motivated me most at the time was that Modern Portfolio Theory was around since 1990 yet at that point still most optimization libraries were proprietary.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Tech behind this Site</title><link>http://localhost:1313/2024/01/15/the-tech-behind-this-site/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/2024/01/15/the-tech-behind-this-site/</guid><description>&lt;p>Similar to how Simon Willison describes his difficulties managing images for his &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/">approach to running a link blog&lt;/a> I found it hard to remain true to pure markdown syntax but have images embedded in a responsive way on this site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My current pipeline is as follows: I host my all my images in a R2 bucket and serve them from &lt;code>static.philippdubach.com&lt;/code>. I use Cloudflares&amp;rsquo;s image resizing CDN do I never have to worry about serving images in appropriate size or format. I basically just upload them with the highes possible quality and Cloudflare takes care of the rest.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
