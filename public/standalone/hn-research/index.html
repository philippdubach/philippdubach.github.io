For the technical implementation, see Building a Real-Time HN Archive.\\nHow does collective attention get allocated in online communities? The question matters because digital platforms now mediate most information consumption, and the mechanisms by which content gains visibility, sustains engagement, and fades from consciousness carry both theoretical and practical weight.\\nThe standard model goes like this: attention follows power laws, success breeds success through preferential attachment (the Matthew effect), and a few winners take most while the long tail gets scraps. This model predicts that initial advantages compound, that rich get richer, that early momentum creates positive feedback loops. But does the data back this claim?\\nI built a real-time archiving system for Hacker News using Cloudflare Workers, capturing content as it appears and tracking changes over time. During December 3-11, 2025, the system collected 98,586 items (stories, comments, polls, and job postings spanning content created from 2007 to December 2025), 22,457 temporal snapshots capturing score and comment evolution, and AI-enriched metadata with topic classification across 13 categories, sentiment scores, and content type labels.\\nSnapshots were captured under multiple conditions: score spikes (≥20 point increases), front-page appearance, periodic sampling, and initial discovery. This selective strategy prioritizes high-engagement content while maintaining efficiency, though it creates some bias toward successful posts in lifecycle estimates.\\nHacker News makes an interesting test case. Unlike platforms with opaque recommendation algorithms, HN uses a relatively open ranking formula based on upvotes, time decay, and penalty factors. The relationship between user behavior and content visibility is more tractable than on algorithmic platforms. The technology-focused community and consistent design over 18 years provides stability that most social platforms lack.\\nHow quickly does content fade from collective consciousness? I modeled attention velocity as a function of time, comparing power-law decay $v(t) = a \\\\cdot t^{-\\\\alpha}$ against exponential decay $v(t) = a \\\\cdot e^{-\\\\lambda t}$. The power-law model (α = 0.56, R² = 0.73) outperforms exponential (λ = 0.12, R² = 0.71) with ΔAIC = 20.1, providing strong evidence for power-law dynamics.\\nThis sub-linear exponent (α \\u0026lt; 1) means attention persists longer than exponential decay would predict. Content doesn\\u0026rsquo;t vanish suddenly. It fades gradually, with occasional late-life bursts when someone rediscovers and shares an old post.\\nWu and Huberman (2007) observed similar patterns on Digg, finding power-law decay with comparable exponents. The persistence may reflect HN\\u0026rsquo;s ranking algorithm, which penalizes rapid score accumulation to maintain content diversity, or community norms that sustain interest in quality discussion.\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s where things get interesting. Standard preferential attachment theory predicts positive correlation between current status and future growth. Popular posts should attract more attention because they\\u0026rsquo;re already popular, creating compounding advantages.\\nI tested this by computing Spearman correlation between current score and instantaneous growth rate across all snapshot pairs. The result: ρ = -0.04 (p \\u0026lt; 10⁻⁵). Weak, but negative.\\nHigh-scoring posts don\\u0026rsquo;t receive disproportionately more attention. If anything, growth velocity slightly decreases as score increases. Sensitivity analysis across score ranges confirms this pattern holds consistently: ρ = -0.01 for scores 1-10, ρ = -0.03 for 10-30, ρ = -0.06 for 30-100, and ρ = -0.05 for 100-1000. All weakly negative or non-significant.\\nHN\\u0026rsquo;s design appears to actively counteract preferential attachment, possibly through algorithmic gravity penalties on high-scoring content or community resistance to pile-on behavior.\\nThis result matches Hagar and Shaw\\u0026rsquo;s (2022) observation of \\u0026ldquo;concentration without cumulative advantage\\u0026rdquo; on Reddit. They found high attention inequality without corresponding preferential attachment, a pattern that contradicts simple rich-get-richer models. My HN data confirms this paradox exists across platforms.\\nDespite absent preferential attachment, HN exhibits extreme attention inequality. The overall Gini coefficient: 0.91. The bottom 80% of posts receive less than 10% of total upvotes.\\nFor context, Zhu and Lerman (2016) reported Gini coefficients of 0.68-0.86 across Twitter metrics. HN exceeds even Twitter\\u0026rsquo;s inequality.\\nBut the Gini varies substantially by subset: 0.45 for low-score posts (score \\u0026lt; 30), 0.20 for medium-score (30-100), and 0.42 for high-score (≥100). This suggests the extreme overall inequality reflects the bimodal nature of HN success, many posts at 1-2 points paired with fewer at high scores, rather than inequality within success tiers.\\nThis apparent paradox, high inequality without preferential attachment, suggests that initial conditions rather than cumulative advantage drive success disparities. Post timing, topic selection, title framing, who happens to see the post first: these early factors set trajectories that rarely change.\\nHow long do posts remain \\u0026ldquo;alive\\u0026rdquo; in terms of receiving engagement? I constructed empirical survival curves where lifetime represents the span from first to last observed snapshot.\\nResults for items with sufficient snapshot coverage (n = 848): median lifetime of 24.0 hours, mean lifetime of 32.3 hours.\\nViral posts (score ≥100) exhibit substantially longer active lifespans, with 50% still receiving engagement at 24+ hours. Lower-scoring posts decay rapidly.\\nThese estimates likely undercount true lifetimes for low-engagement content due to sampling bias. The snapshot strategy prioritizes high-performing posts, so we observe their full lifecycle while likely missing late activity on quieter content.\\nWhen should you post? The data shows systematic variation by hour (UTC). Peak posting volume hits 15:00 UTC (roughly 10-11am US Eastern), while peak average score occurs at 13:00 UTC.\\nThe 2-hour offset suggests that early-afternoon posts (US morning) face less competition and achieve higher engagement per post. Weekend posts show marginally higher mean scores (36.0 vs 34.6), possibly reflecting reduced competition or different content mix.\\nBut here\\u0026rsquo;s the catch: these timing effects are small. They might shift your expected score by a few percentage points. The initial velocity effect dwarfs them.\\nThe most striking result concerns prediction. Early engagement velocity (points per hour in the first 2 hours) correlates with final score at ρ = 0.74 (p \\u0026lt; 10⁻¹¹⁵).\\nFor comparison, initial score alone correlates at just ρ = 0.36. Velocity, not starting position, matters.\\nA classifier based on top-20% early velocity achieves 97.6% precision (when we predict viral, we\\u0026rsquo;re almost always right) and 39.2% recall (we catch about 40% of eventual viral posts).\\nThis precision-recall tradeoff has practical implications. Early velocity provides a dependable but conservative signal for surfacing promising content. Most posts we flag as viral will indeed go viral. But we\\u0026rsquo;ll miss some late bloomers.\\nFollowing Clauset et al. (2009), I applied rigorous maximum likelihood estimation with optimal x_min selection via KS minimization. The analysis identifies x_min = 731 with α = 3.52 ± 0.25 in the tail. This exponent falls within the 2-4 range typical of social systems.\\nLikelihood-ratio tests comparing power-law to alternative distributions yield inconclusive results: vs. exponential (R = +1.69, p = 0.09), vs. lognormal (R = -0.30, p = 0.77), vs. truncated power-law (R = -0.62, p = 0.49). None achieve statistical significance at p \\u0026lt; 0.05, suggesting the distribution may be better characterized as heavy-tailed without strict adherence to any single parametric form. This is actually a common finding in empirical social data.\\nThe AI classification reveals topic-specific performance patterns. Artificial intelligence and programming content dominates both volume and average engagement. Science and security posts punch above their weight in per-post performance.\\nSentiment analysis shows that posts with neutral to moderately positive sentiment perform best. Highly negative content underperforms on average, though exceptions exist for posts expressing justified criticism or outrage at genuine problems.\\nThe combination of extreme inequality, absent preferential attachment, and strong early-velocity predictability suggests success on HN is largely determined within the first hours of posting.\\nFor platform designers, the absence of Matthew effects demonstrates that algorithmic design can counteract cumulative advantage without eliminating inequality. HN\\u0026rsquo;s gravity penalty and community norms prevent runaway success, yet the system remains highly unequal. Inequality stems from initial sorting, who sees new content first, rather than amplification.\\nFor content creators, the strong predictability from early velocity (ρ = 0.74) means \\u0026ldquo;going viral\\u0026rdquo; is largely determined by initial reception. Optimization efforts should focus on launch conditions: timing, title construction, initial audience. Hoping for later discovery rarely works.\\nFor researchers, the decoupling of high Gini from preferential attachment matches Hagar and Shaw\\u0026rsquo;s concentration without cumulative advantage. Future work should investigate which initial conditions drive this inequality, whether topic selection, network position, or presentation factors.\\nSeveral caveats apply. The snapshot sampling prioritizes high-engagement content, possibly biasing survival estimates. The 8-day collection window limits analysis of long-term trends. I cannot distinguish organic engagement from coordinated activity. The AI classification relies on language models that may reflect training biases, and sentiment analysis is particularly noisy for technical content where domain-specific language can confuse general-purpose models.\\nThis analysis documents attention allocation in an online community designed to reward quality over popularity signals. Early velocity predicts final success (ρ = 0.74), combined with absent preferential attachment, suggests content fate is determined within hours. The extreme Gini coefficient (0.91) confirms attention inequality persists even in communities that successfully counteract cumulative advantage.\\nThe paradox of concentration without cumulative advantage suggests we need to look earlier in the funnel. If success doesn\\u0026rsquo;t breed success, then inequality must emerge from initial conditions. Understanding those conditions, why some posts get immediate traction while others don\\u0026rsquo;t, requires data we don\\u0026rsquo;t yet have: the social graphs of early voters, the attention state of the community at posting time, the subtle signals that make one title more clickable than another.\\nThe archiving system and raw data are available at github.com/philippdubach/hn-archiver. Analysis code is at github.com/philippdubach/hn-analyzer. A full paper with additional methodology details is available as PDF.\\nQuantifying attention allocation and predicting engagement from early signals has applications beyond social platforms. The same analytical framework, power-law distributions, survival analysis, early-velocity prediction, applies to client behavior in financial services, where understanding which interactions lead to conversion and which signals predict long-term engagement shapes both product design and relationship management strategy.\\nReferences\\nBarabási, A.-L.
