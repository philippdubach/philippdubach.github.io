This means what was once a diversified investment across 500 companies is now heavily weighted toward a small number of tech giants, many of which are betting heavily on AI.\\nThe top 10 US companies dominate the world equity market: Top 5 US tech firms alone have a collective value ($17.6) that exceeds the combined GDP of the Japan, India, UK, France, and Italy ($17.1).\\nSource: Compustat, IBES, FactSet, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research. As of October 8, 2025 (via Goldman Sachs Investment Outlook 2026)\\nEven though there might be a consensus view among analysts that elevated valuations are supported by earnings growth rather than multiple expansion alone,\\nValuations are especially high in the US. The S\\u0026amp;P500 trades at 23 times forward earnings, near the top of its historical range. While the Nasdaq’s 30× trailing P/E is well below the dotcom bubble peak, it still reflects significant optimism. Outside the US, valuations are more moderate: European and Chinese equities are 10% and 7% above their 20-year average valuations, respectively, and Japan’s index trades at a discount to its long-term average. via UBS Year Ahead\\nSource: Stock Market Data Used in \\u0026ldquo;Irrational Exuberance\\u0026rdquo; Princeton University Press, 2000, 2005, 2015, updated Robert J. Shiller\\nUnder these circumstances, small-cap and international equities offering more attractive entry points than US large-cap indices. This offers the opportunity to shift part of the US equity holding out of the S\\u0026amp;P 500 into a mix of: S\\u0026amp;P 500 value index funds (excluding high P/E ratio stocks), mid-cap stocks, international index funds (for geographic diversification), and small-cap stocks (which have more normal valuations and haven\\u0026rsquo;t experienced the same speculative growth). This also aligns with my view that the AI boom might not end with a winner-takes-all situation for the hyperscalers.\\nUS Dollar Depreciation Expected Despite Continued Dominance: There is a larger consensus among analysts for a continued dollar weakness, with JP Morgan estimating the currency remains ~10% overvalued and Goldman Sachs projecting 4% depreciation over the coming year. Goldman Sachs makes a crucial distinction: dollar dominance in global finance will erode only slowly over decades through structural shifts in trade and GDP share, while dollar valuation can decline much faster due to less exceptional US economic performance and difficulty attracting unhedged capital flows. The key driver is the US\\u0026rsquo;s shrinking share of global trade and persistent fiscal deficits, not an imminent collapse of reserve currency status. Which aligns with a lot of the points we outlined in our previous review of Pozsar\\u0026rsquo;s Bretton Woods III.\\nThis distinction is clearly visible in historical data: the dollar\\u0026rsquo;s share of global reserves has declined gradually from 72% in 1999 to 56% by 2024—a structural erosion occurring over 25 years. In contrast, the trade-weighted dollar index has experienced far more volatile swings, fluctuating between 95 and 130 over the same period, with particularly sharp movements during crisis periods (2008 financial crisis, 2020 pandemic). The dollar can lose 15-20% of its value in just a few years while maintaining its reserve currency dominance. Recent strength to 130 in 2022-2024 appears unsustainable given widening fiscal deficits and declining US share of global trade, suggesting room for significant near-term depreciation even as the dollar\\u0026rsquo;s reserve status erodes only gradually.\\nSource: IMF COFER (Quarterly) and Federal Reserve FRED Trade-Weighted Dollar Index (Monthly), 1999-2024\\nThe divergence between structural dominance (slow decline) and cyclical valuation (rapid fluctuations) demonstrates that dollar depreciation can occur independently of reserve currency status changes. Gold and the dollar typically move in opposite directions—when the dollar weakens, gold becomes more attractive as an alternative store of value, driving its price higher. The outlook for gold in 2026 reflects a convergence of supportive factors beyond simple dollar weakness. Gold has already broken above $4'000/oz for the first time, driven by \\u0026ldquo;persistent inflation volatility and increasing demand from both investors and central banks.\\u0026rdquo; The structural case strengthens as central banks accelerate reserve diversification, with official sector gold purchases reaching record levels in 2023-2024 as institutions reduce dollar concentration.\\nSource: Yahoo Finance GC=F and DX-Y.NYB daily closing prices since January 2000\\nI modestly increased my FX-hedged gold position from 4.6% to 5.0%, reflecting upgraded return forecasts but keeping the allocation measured given gold\\u0026rsquo;s already strong performance (up 45% in 2025). This increase captures institutional conviction without chasing performance. For more on the USD positions see the FX / hedge section.\\n• AI Investment Remains Central But Requires Scrutiny: All four reports position AI as the dominant investment catalyst, with capex projected to reach $571 billion in 2026 (UBS) and potentially $1.3 trillion by 2030. The five largest hyperscalers now account for ~27% of S\\u0026amp;P 500 capital expenditure. Sources: UBS (2026: $571B projection, 2030: $1.3T projection). Historical comparisons: BEA, Manhattan District History, Federal Highway Administration, company filings.\\nAI capital expenditure is projected to reach $1.3 trillion by 2030 (3.8% of US GDP), which would exceed all previous infrastructure booms including broadband (1.15%), electricity (0.98%), and the Apollo program (0.74%). However, as UBS notes,\\nno investment boom has ever seen capital spending perfectly match future demand.\\nI personally view the current AI boom as potentially speculative at least in terms of the current valuations, with many top S\\u0026amp;P companies having inflated price-to-earnings ratios. I\\u0026rsquo;m also not convinced that AGI is imminent or that AI model providers will capture most of the economic value, believing AI may become a competitive commodity where value flows to companies using AI rather than those providing it.\\nIn terms of portfolio allocation the derived actions are consistent with what we outlined in (1) Market Concentration and Active Management Opportunity.\\n• European Fiscal Revolution Creates Investment Opportunities: Germany\\u0026rsquo;s historic abandonment of its debt brake policy, committing over €1 trillion to infrastructure, defense, and security spending (with an additional €600 billion in private sector commitments), represents a paradigm shift. JP Morgan upgrades eurozone growth to 1.5% and Goldman Sachs identifies a \\u0026ldquo;new paradigm\\u0026rdquo; focused on defense independence, energy security, and reindustrialization. This fiscal activism is expected to narrow the US-Europe growth differential from 60bps to 30bps, making European equities—currently trading at a 22% discount to global peers—increasingly attractive despite elevated valuations elsewhere.\\n• Fixed Income Offers Best Prospects Since Global Financial Crisis: Higher starting yields and steeper curves have dramatically improved bond return potential, with JP Morgan forecasting 10-year US Treasuries to deliver 4.6% and expecting medium-duration quality bonds to generate \\u0026ldquo;mid-single-digit returns.\\u0026rdquo; All reports project 2-3 additional Fed rate cuts in 2026, while the ECB is expected to hold steady and the Bank of Japan to continue hiking. Goldman Sachs emphasizes that \\u0026ldquo;front-end yields are more sensitive to central bank policy and offer strong counter-cyclical properties,\\u0026rdquo; while fiscal concerns drive term-risk premia higher at the long end, benefiting strategic curve positioning.\\nSource: Bloomberg, NBER, J.P.

However, both firms view this as manageable rather than systemic, with Goldman Sachs noting that \\u0026ldquo;borrowers with coverage ratios above 1.5x (representing 55-60% of the market)\\u0026rdquo; have sufficient equity cushions. The critical distinction is vintage year: 2021-2022 investments face challenges from peak valuations, while 2018-2020 vintages remain \\u0026ldquo;positioned for attractive returns.\\u0026rdquo; Manager selection and entry timing are paramount.\\nSource: Bloomberg, Datastream, Haver, J.P.

(via: J.P.Morgan Asset Management 2026 Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions)\\nOver the last 30 years, equities, gold and REITs are winners, but the 60/40 has delivered steady returns in most time periods Relative performance of selected assets over discrete five-year periods from 1995-2025\\n** Section on FX risk here** For CHF-based investors specifically, gold\\u0026rsquo;s appeal is amplified through multiple channels. First, the expected 4-10% dollar depreciation translates directly into higher gold prices in dollar terms, but CHF-hedged gold exposure (as in our iShares CH Gold CHF Hedged ETF position) isolates this return from currency fluctuations, capturing gold\\u0026rsquo;s intrinsic move. Second, gold serves as a portfolio stabilizer during periods when stock-bond correlations turn positive—a risk all three reports highlight given higher inflation volatility. Goldman Sachs notes that gold has historically provided \\u0026ldquo;returns that are uncorrelated to public markets\\u0026rdquo; and particularly shines during \\u0026ldquo;negative supply shocks and fiscal misbehavior shocks\\u0026rdquo; where traditional bonds fail as hedges. Third, the structural de-dollarization trend, while slow, creates persistent buying pressure from official institutions seeking alternatives to dollar reserves.\\nGiven this outlook, our portfolio adjustments incorporate three specific responses. First, we maintain full CHF hedging on our US equity exposure (28% of portfolio via iShares S\\u0026amp;P 500 CHF Hedged ETF), protecting against the 4-10% dollar depreciation consensus while capturing US equity returns. This hedging decision is critical—an unhedged 28% US position would face potential currency losses of 1.1-2.8% even if US stocks perform well in local terms.\\nThird, we leave our European (13.2%), Japanese (3.2%), and emerging Asian (12.5%) equity exposures unhedged, as these currencies are expected to strengthen against the dollar (EUR to 1.20, JPY to 118, CNY appreciation of ~10%). For CHF investors, this creates a favorable dynamic where European fiscal stimulus and Asian growth drive equity gains while currency movements provide additional tailwinds rather than headwinds.\\nThe combination of hedged US exposure, increased gold allocation, and strategic unhedged positions in appreciating-currency markets represents a balanced approach to the dollar depreciation thesis. It protects against the downside (dollar losses on US assets) while capturing upside (currency gains on non-US assets and gold\\u0026rsquo;s inverse correlation to the dollar). For context, if the dollar depreciates 7% (midpoint of forecasts) over 2026, an unhedged US equity portfolio would require 7% local currency gains just to break even in CHF terms, while our hedged approach requires no such offset. Meanwhile, our 4.9% gold position benefits from both dollar weakness and structural central bank demand, potentially contributing 0.25-0.30% to total portfolio returns (5.5% return on 4.9% allocation) with low correlation to other holdings. This positioning aligns with Goldman Sachs\\u0026rsquo; observation that \\u0026ldquo;in a world of evolving megatrends,\\u0026rdquo; combining \\u0026ldquo;growth assets with real assets like gold\\u0026rdquo; creates resilience against multiple macro scenarios including dollar depreciation, inflation surprises, and geopolitical shocks.\\nBut how did we get here: (1) After combing through insights and data from analyst and research outlooks by Goldman Sachs Asset Management, J.P.

The five largest hyperscalers now account for ~27% of S\\u0026amp;P 500 capital expenditure. Sources: UBS (2026: $571B projection, 2030: $1.3T projection). Historical comparisons: BEA, Manhattan District History, Federal Highway Administration, company filings.\\nAI capital expenditure is projected to reach $1.3 trillion by 2030 (3.8% of US GDP), which would exceed all previous infrastructure booms including broadband (1.15%), electricity (0.98%), and the Apollo program (0.74%). However, as UBS notes,\\nno investment boom has ever seen capital spending perfectly match future demand.\\nI personally view the current AI boom as potentially speculative at least in terms of the current valuations, with many top S\\u0026amp;P companies having inflated price-to-earnings ratios. I\\u0026rsquo;m also not convinced that AGI is imminent or that AI model providers will capture most of the economic value, believing AI may become a competitive commodity where value flows to companies using AI rather than those providing it.\\nIn terms of portfolio allocation the derived actions are consistent with what we outlined in (1) Market Concentration and Active Management Opportunity.\\n• European Fiscal Revolution Creates Investment Opportunities: Germany\\u0026rsquo;s historic abandonment of its debt brake policy, committing over €1 trillion to infrastructure, defense, and security spending (with an additional €600 billion in private sector commitments), represents a paradigm shift. JP Morgan upgrades eurozone growth to 1.5% and Goldman Sachs identifies a \\u0026ldquo;new paradigm\\u0026rdquo; focused on defense independence, energy security, and reindustrialization. This fiscal activism is expected to narrow the US-Europe growth differential from 60bps to 30bps, making European equities—currently trading at a 22% discount to global peers—increasingly attractive despite elevated valuations elsewhere.\\n• Fixed Income Offers Best Prospects Since Global Financial Crisis: Higher starting yields and steeper curves have dramatically improved bond return potential, with JP Morgan forecasting 10-year US Treasuries to deliver 4.6% and expecting medium-duration quality bonds to generate \\u0026ldquo;mid-single-digit returns.\\u0026rdquo; All reports project 2-3 additional Fed rate cuts in 2026, while the ECB is expected to hold steady and the Bank of Japan to continue hiking. Goldman Sachs emphasizes that \\u0026ldquo;front-end yields are more sensitive to central bank policy and offer strong counter-cyclical properties,\\u0026rdquo; while fiscal concerns drive term-risk premia higher at the long end, benefiting strategic curve positioning.\\nSource: Bloomberg, NBER, J.P.

First, the expected 4-10% dollar depreciation translates directly into higher gold prices in dollar terms, but CHF-hedged gold exposure (as in our iShares CH Gold CHF Hedged ETF position) isolates this return from currency fluctuations, capturing gold\\u0026rsquo;s intrinsic move. Second, gold serves as a portfolio stabilizer during periods when stock-bond correlations turn positive—a risk all three reports highlight given higher inflation volatility. Goldman Sachs notes that gold has historically provided \\u0026ldquo;returns that are uncorrelated to public markets\\u0026rdquo; and particularly shines during \\u0026ldquo;negative supply shocks and fiscal misbehavior shocks\\u0026rdquo; where traditional bonds fail as hedges. Third, the structural de-dollarization trend, while slow, creates persistent buying pressure from official institutions seeking alternatives to dollar reserves.\\nGiven this outlook, our portfolio adjustments incorporate three specific responses. First, we maintain full CHF hedging on our US equity exposure (28% of portfolio via iShares S\\u0026amp;P 500 CHF Hedged ETF), protecting against the 4-10% dollar depreciation consensus while capturing US equity returns. This hedging decision is critical—an unhedged 28% US position would face potential currency losses of 1.1-2.8% even if US stocks perform well in local terms.\\nThird, we leave our European (13.2%), Japanese (3.2%), and emerging Asian (12.5%) equity exposures unhedged, as these currencies are expected to strengthen against the dollar (EUR to 1.20, JPY to 118, CNY appreciation of ~10%). For CHF investors, this creates a favorable dynamic where European fiscal stimulus and Asian growth drive equity gains while currency movements provide additional tailwinds rather than headwinds.\\nThe combination of hedged US exposure, increased gold allocation, and strategic unhedged positions in appreciating-currency markets represents a balanced approach to the dollar depreciation thesis. It protects against the downside (dollar losses on US assets) while capturing upside (currency gains on non-US assets and gold\\u0026rsquo;s inverse correlation to the dollar). For context, if the dollar depreciates 7% (midpoint of forecasts) over 2026, an unhedged US equity portfolio would require 7% local currency gains just to break even in CHF terms, while our hedged approach requires no such offset. Meanwhile, our 4.9% gold position benefits from both dollar weakness and structural central bank demand, potentially contributing 0.25-0.30% to total portfolio returns (5.5% return on 4.9% allocation) with low correlation to other holdings. This positioning aligns with Goldman Sachs\\u0026rsquo; observation that \\u0026ldquo;in a world of evolving megatrends,\\u0026rdquo; combining \\u0026ldquo;growth assets with real assets like gold\\u0026rdquo; creates resilience against multiple macro scenarios including dollar depreciation, inflation surprises, and geopolitical shocks.\\nBut how did we get here: (1) After combing through insights and data from analyst and research outlooks by Goldman Sachs Asset Management, J.P.

This offers the opportunity to shift part of the US equity holding out of the S&amp;P 500 into a mix of: S&amp;P 500 value index funds (excluding high P/E ratio stocks), mid-cap stocks, international index funds (for geographic diversification), and small-cap stocks (which have more normal valuations and haven&rsquo;t experienced the same speculative growth). This also aligns with my view that <a href=/2025/11/23/is-ai-really-eating-the-world/>the AI boom might not end with a winner-takes-all situation for the hyperscalers</a>.</p><p><strong>US Dollar Depreciation Expected Despite Continued Dominance</strong>: There is a larger consensus among analysts for a continued dollar weakness, with JP Morgan estimating the currency remains ~10% overvalued and Goldman Sachs projecting 4% depreciation over the coming year. Goldman Sachs makes a crucial distinction: dollar dominance in global finance will erode only slowly over decades through structural shifts in trade and GDP share, while dollar valuation can decline much faster due to less exceptional US economic performance and difficulty attracting unhedged capital flows. The key driver is the US&rsquo;s shrinking share of global trade and persistent fiscal deficits, not an imminent collapse of reserve currency status. Which aligns with a lot of the points we outlined in our previous review of <a href=/2025/10/26/pozsars-bretton-woods-iii-three-years-later-2/2/>Pozsar&rsquo;s Bretton Woods III</a>.</p><p>This distinction is clearly visible in historical data: the dollar&rsquo;s share of global reserves has declined gradually from 72% in 1999 to 56% by 2024—a structural erosion occurring over 25 years. In contrast, the trade-weighted dollar index has experienced far more volatile swings, fluctuating between 95 and 130 over the same period, with particularly sharp movements during crisis periods (2008 financial crisis, 2020 pandemic). The dollar can lose 15-20% of its value in just a few years while maintaining its reserve currency dominance. Recent strength to 130 in 2022-2024 appears unsustainable given widening fiscal deficits and declining US share of global trade, suggesting room for significant near-term depreciation even as the dollar&rsquo;s reserve status erodes only gradually.</p><p><picture style="display:block;width:80%;margin:0 auto;padding:1rem 0"><source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset="https://static.philippdubach.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=320,quality=80,format=webp/dollar_dominance_chart.png 320w,

Gold and the dollar typically move in opposite directions—when the dollar weakens, gold becomes more attractive as an alternative store of value, driving its price higher. The outlook for gold in 2026 reflects a convergence of supportive factors beyond simple dollar weakness. Gold has already broken above $4'000/oz for the first time, driven by &ldquo;persistent inflation volatility and increasing demand from both investors and central banks.&rdquo; The structural case strengthens as central banks accelerate reserve diversification, with official sector gold purchases reaching record levels in 2023-2024 as institutions reduce dollar concentration.</p><p><picture style="display:block;width:80%;margin:0 auto;padding:1rem 0"><source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset="https://static.philippdubach.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=320,quality=80,format=webp/gold_dollar_chart.png 320w,

First, the expected 4-10% dollar depreciation translates directly into higher gold prices in dollar terms, but CHF-hedged gold exposure (as in our iShares CH Gold CHF Hedged ETF position) isolates this return from currency fluctuations, capturing gold&rsquo;s intrinsic move. Second, gold serves as a portfolio stabilizer during periods when stock-bond correlations turn positive—a risk all three reports highlight given higher inflation volatility. Goldman Sachs notes that gold has historically provided &ldquo;returns that are uncorrelated to public markets&rdquo; and particularly shines during &ldquo;negative supply shocks and fiscal misbehavior shocks&rdquo; where traditional bonds fail as hedges. Third, the structural de-dollarization trend, while slow, creates persistent buying pressure from official institutions seeking alternatives to dollar reserves.</p><p>Given this outlook, our portfolio adjustments incorporate three specific responses. First, we maintain full CHF hedging on our US equity exposure (28% of portfolio via iShares S&amp;P 500 CHF Hedged ETF), protecting against the 4-10% dollar depreciation consensus while capturing US equity returns. This hedging decision is critical—an unhedged 28% US position would face potential currency losses of 1.1-2.8% even if US stocks perform well in local terms.</p><p>Third, we leave our European (13.2%), Japanese (3.2%), and emerging Asian (12.5%) equity exposures unhedged, as these currencies are expected to strengthen against the dollar (EUR to 1.20, JPY to 118, CNY appreciation of ~10%). For CHF investors, this creates a favorable dynamic where European fiscal stimulus and Asian growth drive equity gains while currency movements provide additional tailwinds rather than headwinds.</p><p>The combination of hedged US exposure, increased gold allocation, and strategic unhedged positions in appreciating-currency markets represents a balanced approach to the dollar depreciation thesis. It protects against the downside (dollar losses on US assets) while capturing upside (currency gains on non-US assets and gold&rsquo;s inverse correlation to the dollar). For context, if the dollar depreciates 7% (midpoint of forecasts) over 2026, an unhedged US equity portfolio would require 7% local currency gains just to break even in CHF terms, while our hedged approach requires no such offset. Meanwhile, our 4.9% gold position benefits from both dollar weakness and structural central bank demand, potentially contributing 0.25-0.30% to total portfolio returns (5.5% return on 4.9% allocation) with low correlation to other holdings. This positioning aligns with Goldman Sachs&rsquo; observation that &ldquo;in a world of evolving megatrends,&rdquo; combining &ldquo;growth assets with real assets like gold&rdquo; creates resilience against multiple macro scenarios including dollar depreciation, inflation surprises, and geopolitical shocks.</p><section id=end></section><p>But how did we get here: (1) After combing through insights and data from analyst and research outlooks by <a href=https://am.gs.com/en-hk/advisors/insights/article/investment-outlook>Goldman Sachs Asset Management</a>, <a href=https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/global/en/insights/portfolio-insights/ltcma/noindex/ltcma-full-report.pdf>J.P.
