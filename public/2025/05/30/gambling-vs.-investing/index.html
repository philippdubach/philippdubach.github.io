Even better, a Kalshi board member is awaiting confirmation to lead the very agency that was previously their biggest antagonist.</p><p>The technical distinction matters: Kalshi operates as an exchange between traders rather than a house taking bets against customers. But functionally, with 79% of their recent trading volume being sports-related, they&rsquo;re forcing us to confront an uncomfortable reality about risk, speculation, and what we choose to call &ldquo;investing.&rdquo;</p><p>Whether you call it innovation or regulatory arbitrage, Kalshi is exposing the arbitrary nature of the lines we&rsquo;ve drawn around acceptable financial speculation.<br>_ _</p><p><em>(17/06/2025) Update: Matt Levine - one of the finance columnists I enjoy reading most - just published a long piece <a href=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-06-17/it-s-not-gambling-it-s-predicting>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Not Gambling, It&rsquo;s Predicting&rdquo;</a> in his newsletter on exactly this issue:</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Kalshi offers a prediction market where you can bet on sports. No! Sorry! Wrong! It offers a prediction market where you can predict which team will win a sports game, and if you predict correctly you make money, and if you predict incorrectly you lose money.
