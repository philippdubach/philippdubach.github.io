remaining. The raw numbers are striking. But what they actually mean depends on where you look. The funding isn\\u0026rsquo;t evenly distributed. It\\u0026rsquo;s concentrated in infrastructure companies, research labs building foundation models, and a handful of application layer companies that have found product-market fit. The rest are betting that AI will transform their specific verticals, which may or may not happen.\\nThe total funding across these 49 companies exceeds $70 billion. That\\u0026rsquo;s roughly equivalent to the annual GDP of Croatia or the market capitalization of Starbucks. But unlike GDP or market cap, this is cash that needs to generate returns. The question isn\\u0026rsquo;t whether AI will be important. It\\u0026rsquo;s whether these specific companies, at these specific valuations, will generate returns that justify the capital deployed.\\nThe concentration tells a story. OpenAI raised $40 billion in March, valuing the company at $300 billion. Anthropic raised $13 billion in September, reaching a $183 billion valuation. Anysphere, the company behind Cursor, raised $2.3 billion in November, its second mega-round of the year. These three companies alone account for over $55 billion, or roughly 78% of the total. The remaining 46 companies split the other $15 billion. This isn\\u0026rsquo;t a diversified bet on AI. It\\u0026rsquo;s a concentrated bet that foundation models and developer tools will capture most of the value.\\nThe infrastructure layer has attracted the most capital, which makes sense if you believe AI will become a utility. Cerebras Systems raised $1.1 billion. Groq raised $750 million. Lambda raised $480 million. These companies build the chips and compute infrastructure that power AI models. The thesis is straightforward: as AI adoption grows, demand for compute will grow faster. But there\\u0026rsquo;s a problem. The hyperscalers are building their own infrastructure. Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta will invest roughly $400 billion in AI infrastructure in 2025, more than global telecommunications capital expenditure. When your customers are also your competitors, the unit economics get complicated.\\nThe research labs building foundation models face a different challenge. OpenAI, Anthropic, and a handful of others are racing to build models that can handle increasingly complex tasks. But the performance gap is narrowing. DeepSeek proved that anyone with $500 million can build a frontier model. Costs have collapsed. OpenAI\\u0026rsquo;s API pricing has dropped by 97% since GPT-3\\u0026rsquo;s launch. Every year brings an order of magnitude decline in the price of a given output. When your product becomes a commodity faster than you can build a moat, the economics don\\u0026rsquo;t work.\\nThe application layer is where things get interesting. Companies like Harvey, which builds AI tools for legal work, raised $300 million twice this year, reaching a $5 billion valuation. Abridge, which transcribes patient-clinician conversations, raised $300 million and reached $5.3 billion. These companies have found product-market fit in specific verticals. But they\\u0026rsquo;re also competing with general-purpose models that get better every month. The question is whether vertical-specific models and workflows can maintain a defensible advantage, or whether general-purpose models will eventually subsume their use cases.\\nHealthcare has been a particular focus. Hippocratic AI raised $126 million in November, its second round of the year. Ambience Healthcare raised $243 million. OpenEvidence raised $200 million in October, its second round of 2025. The thesis is that healthcare requires specialized models trained on medical data, with guardrails that general-purpose models can\\u0026rsquo;t provide. But healthcare is also heavily regulated, slow to adopt new technology, and resistant to change. Whether these companies can navigate that complexity while maintaining growth rates that justify their valuations remains to be seen.\\nThe investor concentration is equally striking. Andreessen Horowitz appears in at least 12 of these rounds. Kleiner Perkins appears in at least 10. Lightspeed Venture Partners appears in at least 9. Nvidia, which has become a strategic investor as much as a chipmaker, appears in at least 8. This isn\\u0026rsquo;t diversification. It\\u0026rsquo;s a small group of investors making large bets on a small number of companies, with significant overlap in their portfolios. If AI succeeds broadly, they\\u0026rsquo;ll all do well. If it doesn\\u0026rsquo;t, or if the returns are more modest than expected, the losses will be concentrated too.\\nThe comparison to 2024 is revealing. Last year, 49 companies raised $100 million or more. This year, 49 companies have done the same, but more companies have raised multiple mega-rounds. Anysphere raised $900 million in June and $2.3 billion in November. Anthropic raised $3.5 billion in March and $13 billion in September. Harvey raised $300 million in February and another $300 million in June. This suggests that either these companies are growing faster than expected, or investors are doubling down on winners, or both. But it also suggests that the market is moving faster than it did in 2024, with less time between rounds and higher valuations at each stage.\\nThe economic question is whether this represents sustainable investment or speculative excess. The dot-com bubble of the late 1990s saw similar concentration. A small number of companies captured most of the funding, valuations reached levels that seemed disconnected from fundamentals, and investors justified the prices by pointing to the technology\\u0026rsquo;s potential to change how business works. Some of those companies, like Amazon and Google, became among the most valuable in the world. Most didn\\u0026rsquo;t. The difference this time is that AI is being deployed across existing businesses, not just creating new ones. But that also means the competition is more intense, and the path to profitability may be longer.\\nThere\\u0026rsquo;s another pattern that\\u0026rsquo;s worth noting. Many of these companies are building tools for other companies to build AI applications, rather than building end-user applications themselves. Cursor helps developers write code. Harvey helps lawyers do legal work. Abridge helps clinicians document patient visits. The thesis is that AI will augment human capabilities in specific domains, creating productivity gains that justify the software spend. But if general-purpose models continue to improve, and if the cost of using those models continues to fall, the value of vertical-specific tools may compress.\\nThe venture capital math is also worth examining. If you invest $100 million at a $1 billion valuation, you need the company to be worth $10 billion to return 10x. If you invest $1 billion at a $10 billion valuation, you need it to be worth $100 billion. The valuations in these rounds suggest that investors are betting on outcomes that require these companies to become among the most valuable in the world. OpenAI at $300 billion would make it a top-20 company by market cap. Anthropic at $183 billion would put it in the top 50. These aren\\u0026rsquo;t conservative bets.\\nWhat could go wrong? The most obvious risk is that AI adoption takes longer than expected, or that the productivity gains are more modest than projected. Enterprise software sales cycles are long. Regulatory approval in healthcare and other regulated industries can take years. Integration into existing workflows requires change management that many organizations struggle with. If revenue growth doesn\\u0026rsquo;t match the pace of funding, these companies will need to raise more capital at higher valuations, or accept down rounds that reset expectations.\\nAnother risk is that the infrastructure layer becomes commoditized faster than expected. If Microsoft, Google, and Amazon continue to build their own infrastructure, and if the cost of compute continues to fall, the companies building AI infrastructure may find themselves competing on price rather than differentiation. The same dynamic could affect the model layer. If open-source models continue to improve, and if the cost of training continues to fall, proprietary models may struggle to maintain pricing power.\\nThe application layer may be the most defensible, but it\\u0026rsquo;s also the most fragmented. There are dozens of companies building AI tools for specific verticals. Most won\\u0026rsquo;t become $10 billion companies. Some will be acquired. Others will fail. The question is whether the winners will generate enough value to justify the total capital deployed across the category.\\nHere\\u0026rsquo;s what I think is really happening. The funding boom reflects genuine belief that AI will transform how work gets done. But it also reflects a capital allocation problem. There\\u0026rsquo;s too much money chasing too few opportunities that have demonstrated product-market fit. The result is that investors are paying premium prices for companies that may or may not justify those valuations, depending on how quickly AI adoption happens and where the value ultimately accumulates.\\nThe companies that will succeed are the ones that can build defensible advantages faster than their markets commoditize. That might mean proprietary data, network effects, or regulatory moats. But it probably doesn\\u0026rsquo;t mean just having a better model or better infrastructure, because those advantages are eroding. The funding numbers are impressive. But impressive numbers don\\u0026rsquo;t guarantee impressive returns. The next few years will show whether $70 billion was the right amount of capital deployed at the right valuations, or whether it was too much, too early, at prices that assumed outcomes that may not materialize.\\n\"","wordCount":1499,"inLanguage":"en","image":"https:\/\/static.philippdubach.com\/ograph\/ograph-ai-funding-boom.jpg","datePublished":"2025-12-15T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-12-15T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https:\/\/philippdubach.com\/2025\/12\/15\/the-ai-funding-boom-what-70-billion-actually-means\/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"philippdubach","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/philippdubach.com\/icons/favicon.ico"}},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Philipp Dubach"}}</script></head><body class=linkblog><div class=container><aside class=sidebar><div class=sidebar-content><div class=site-header><div class=site-title><a href=https://philippdubach.com/>philippdubach</a></div><p class=site-description>Blog about Personal Projects, Articles and Papers on Economics, Finance and Technology</p></div><nav class=navigation><ul><li><a href=/>Home</a></li><li><a href=/projects/>Projects</a></li><li><a href=/posts/>Archive</a></li><li><a href=/about/>About</a></li><li><a href=/index.xml>RSS</a></li></ul></nav><div class=social-links><a href=https://github.com/philippdubach target=_blank rel=noopener>GitHub</a>

Costs have collapsed. <a href=https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/08/openai-priced-gpt-5-so-low-it-may-spark-a-price-war/>OpenAI&rsquo;s API pricing has dropped by 97% since GPT-3&rsquo;s launch</a>. Every year brings an order of magnitude decline in the price of a given output. When your product becomes a commodity faster than you can build a moat, the economics don&rsquo;t work.</p><a href=#lightbox-ai_cumulative_funding-png-2 style="display:block;width:80%;margin:0 auto;padding:1rem 0;text-decoration:none"><picture class=img-lightbox><source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset="https://static.philippdubach.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=320,quality=80,format=webp/ai_cumulative_funding.png 320w,

Companies like Harvey, which builds AI tools for legal work, raised $300 million twice this year, reaching a $5 billion valuation. Abridge, which transcribes patient-clinician conversations, raised $300 million and reached $5.3 billion. These companies have found product-market fit in specific verticals. But they&rsquo;re also competing with general-purpose models that get better every month. The question is whether vertical-specific models and workflows can maintain a defensible advantage, or whether general-purpose models will eventually subsume their use cases.</p><p>Healthcare has been a particular focus. Hippocratic AI raised $126 million in November, its second round of the year. Ambience Healthcare raised $243 million. OpenEvidence raised $200 million in October, its second round of 2025. The thesis is that healthcare requires specialized models trained on medical data, with guardrails that general-purpose models can&rsquo;t provide. But healthcare is also heavily regulated, slow to adopt new technology, and resistant to change. Whether these companies can navigate that complexity while maintaining growth rates that justify their valuations remains to be seen.</p><p>The investor concentration is equally striking. Andreessen Horowitz appears in at least 12 of these rounds. Kleiner Perkins appears in at least 10. Lightspeed Venture Partners appears in at least 9. Nvidia, which has become a strategic investor as much as a chipmaker, appears in at least 8. This isn&rsquo;t diversification. It&rsquo;s a small group of investors making large bets on a small number of companies, with significant overlap in their portfolios. If AI succeeds broadly, they&rsquo;ll all do well. If it doesn&rsquo;t, or if the returns are more modest than expected, the losses will be concentrated too.</p><a href=#lightbox-ai_top_investors-png-3 style="display:block;width:80%;margin:0 auto;padding:1rem 0;text-decoration:none"><picture class=img-lightbox><source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset="https://static.philippdubach.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=320,quality=80,format=webp/ai_top_investors.png 320w,

Last year, 49 companies raised $100 million or more. This year, 49 companies have done the same, but more companies have raised multiple mega-rounds. Anysphere raised $900 million in June and $2.3 billion in November. Anthropic raised $3.5 billion in March and $13 billion in September. Harvey raised $300 million in February and another $300 million in June. This suggests that either these companies are growing faster than expected, or investors are doubling down on winners, or both. But it also suggests that the market is moving faster than it did in 2024, with less time between rounds and higher valuations at each stage.</p><p>The economic question is whether this represents sustainable investment or speculative excess. The dot-com bubble of the late 1990s saw similar concentration. A small number of companies captured most of the funding, valuations reached levels that seemed disconnected from fundamentals, and investors justified the prices by pointing to the technology&rsquo;s potential to change how business works. Some of those companies, like Amazon and Google, became among the most valuable in the world. Most didn&rsquo;t. The difference this time is that AI is being deployed across existing businesses, not just creating new ones. But that also means the competition is more intense, and the path to profitability may be longer.</p><p>There&rsquo;s another pattern that&rsquo;s worth noting. Many of these companies are building tools for other companies to build AI applications, rather than building end-user applications themselves. Cursor helps developers write code. Harvey helps lawyers do legal work. Abridge helps clinicians document patient visits. The thesis is that AI will augment human capabilities in specific domains, creating productivity gains that justify the software spend. But if general-purpose models continue to improve, and if the cost of using those models continues to fall, the value of vertical-specific tools may compress.</p><p>The venture capital math is also worth examining. If you invest $100 million at a $1 billion valuation, you need the company to be worth $10 billion to return 10x. If you invest $1 billion at a $10 billion valuation, you need it to be worth $100 billion. The valuations in these rounds suggest that investors are betting on outcomes that require these companies to become among the most valuable in the world. OpenAI at $300 billion would make it a top-20 company by market cap. Anthropic at $183 billion would put it in the top 50. These aren&rsquo;t conservative bets.</p><p>What could go wrong? The most obvious risk is that AI adoption takes longer than expected, or that the productivity gains are more modest than projected. Enterprise software sales cycles are long. Regulatory approval in healthcare and other regulated industries can take years. Integration into existing workflows requires change management that many organizations struggle with. If revenue growth doesn&rsquo;t match the pace of funding, these companies will need to raise more capital at higher valuations, or accept down rounds that reset expectations.</p><p>Another risk is that the infrastructure layer becomes commoditized faster than expected. If Microsoft, Google, and Amazon continue to build their own infrastructure, and if the cost of compute continues to fall, the companies building AI infrastructure may find themselves competing on price rather than differentiation. The same dynamic could affect the model layer. If open-source models continue to improve, and if the cost of training continues to fall, proprietary models may struggle to maintain pricing power.</p><p>The application layer may be the most defensible, but it&rsquo;s also the most fragmented. There are dozens of companies building AI tools for specific verticals. Most won&rsquo;t become $10 billion companies. Some will be acquired. Others will fail. The question is whether the winners will generate enough value to justify the total capital deployed across the category.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what I think is really happening. The funding boom reflects genuine belief that AI will transform how work gets done. But it also reflects a capital allocation problem. There&rsquo;s too much money chasing too few opportunities that have demonstrated product-market fit. The result is that investors are paying premium prices for companies that may or may not justify those valuations, depending on how quickly AI adoption happens and where the value ultimately accumulates.</p><p>The companies that will succeed are the ones that can build defensible advantages faster than their markets commoditize. That might mean proprietary data, network effects, or regulatory moats. But it probably doesn&rsquo;t mean just having a better model or better infrastructure, because those advantages are eroding. The funding numbers are impressive. But impressive numbers don&rsquo;t guarantee impressive returns. The next few years will show whether $70 billion was the right amount of capital deployed at the right valuations, or whether it was too much, too early, at prices that assumed outcomes that may not materialize.</p></div></article><footer class=feedback-footer><p>Have feedback, comments, or ideas? <a href=mailto:info@philippdubach.com>I'd love to hear from you</a>.</p><p class=latest-post>Latest: <a href=/2025/12/15/book-review-why-machines-learn-by-anil-ananthaswamy/>Book Review: Why Machines Learn by Anil Ananthaswamy</a></p><p class=most-read id=top-post-week style=min-height:1.5em></p></footer><script src=/js/goatcounter-top.js></script><script>(function(){var t=document.getElementById("share-link"),e=document.getElementById("share-status");if(!t)return;t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.preventDefault(),e.textContent="...";var n,i=encodeURIComponent(window.location.href),s="yourls_"+Date.now(),o=!1;window[s]=function(t){o=!0;var i=t.shorturl;i?navigator.clipboard.writeText(i).then(function(){e.textContent="url copied",setTimeout(function(){e.textContent=""},2e3)}).catch(function(){e.textContent=i,setTimeout(function(){e.textContent=""},4e3)}):(e.textContent="error",setTimeout(function(){e.textContent=""},2e3)),delete window[s],n.parentNode&&n.parentNode.removeChild(n)},n=document.createElement("script"),n.onerror=function(){setTimeout(function(){o||(e.textContent="error",setTimeout(function(){e.textContent=""},2e3)),delete window[s],n.parentNode&&n.parentNode.removeChild(n)},500)},n.src="https://pdub.click/yourls-api.php?signature=4807288869&action=shorturl&format=jsonp&callback="+s+"&url="+i,document.body.appendChild(n)})})()</script></main></div><script>window.goatcounter=window.goatcounter||{},document.referrer&&document.referrer.includes("pdub.click")&&(window.goatcounter.no_onload=!1)</script><script data-goatcounter=https://philippdubach.goatcounter.com/count async src=https://gc.zgo.at/count.js></script></body></html>
