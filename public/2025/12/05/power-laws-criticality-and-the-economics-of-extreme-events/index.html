They had assumed asset returns followed normal distributions, which meant a simultaneous 20% decline across multiple asset classes was a once-in-10,000-year event. But it was happening in real time. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission\\u0026rsquo;s report documented how Value at Risk models used by major banks systematically underestimated tail risk by assuming Gaussian distributions. The models weren\\u0026rsquo;t just wrong about probabilities. They were wrong about the underlying structure. Financial markets don\\u0026rsquo;t follow bell curves. They follow power laws, where extreme events are inevitable features of the system\\u0026rsquo;s architecture.\\nThis isn\\u0026rsquo;t a quirk of finance. In 1896, Italian engineer Vilfredo Pareto analyzed income tax records across Europe and found the same pattern everywhere. His original work, published in 1897, showed that when he plotted income distributions on logarithmic scales, they formed straight lines with slopes around -1.5. The richest 1% didn\\u0026rsquo;t earn twice or ten times more than average. They earned hundreds or thousands of times more. This pattern held across Italy, England, France, and Prussia. Pareto had discovered what we now call a power law distribution, and it appears throughout economic systems: income, wealth, company sizes, city populations, venture capital returns, and market crashes.\\nThe mathematical difference creates fundamentally different risk profiles. In a normal distribution, 95% of observations fall within two standard deviations of the mean. But power laws have no such bounds. Their variance can be infinite. Add Bill Gates to a room of 100 people earning median income, and the average wealth jumps from $50,000 to over $1 billion. Research by Xavier Gabaix shows that firm sizes follow power laws with exponents around -1. Zipf\\u0026rsquo;s law describes how city populations follow power laws. The distribution of market capitalizations, venture capital returns, and financial market drawdowns all exhibit power law behavior.\\nThe explanation comes from physics. When systems operate at a critical point, they exhibit power law behavior because correlations become scale-invariant. At a magnet\\u0026rsquo;s Curie temperature, the correlation length becomes infinite: a flip of one atom\\u0026rsquo;s magnetic moment can influence atoms across the entire material. This is universality: systems with completely different microscopic details exhibit identical behavior at critical points.\\nSome systems naturally drive themselves to criticality through feedback mechanisms. This is self-organized criticality, developed by Per Bak, Chao Tang, and Kurt Wiesenfeld in 1987. Forest fires provide the clearest example: the system self-organizes so small fires prevent catastrophic buildup while large fires clear large areas. In June 1988, a lightning strike near Yellowstone started a fire that would burn 1.4 million acres, 70 times larger than the previous record. The National Park Service\\u0026rsquo;s analysis showed the cause was identical to thousands of other lightning strikes that year. The same pattern appears in earthquakes: the Gutenberg-Richter law shows earthquake magnitudes follow a power law.\\nEconomic systems exhibit the same structure. Horsley Bridge Partners\\u0026rsquo; analysis of their portfolio from 1985 to 2014, covering 7,000 startups, showed that over half lost money completely. Another 30% returned less than the initial investment. But the top 6% generated returns exceeding 10x, and those investments produced 60% of the firm\\u0026rsquo;s total profit. Y Combinator\\u0026rsquo;s analysis through 2025 confirms this pattern: their early data showed 75% of returns came from just two companies out of 280 investments, with Airbnb and Dropbox generating more value than the other 278 combined. More recent analysis shows the power law structure remains even as the portfolio has grown to over 4,000 companies.\\nThe same structure appears in other winner-take-most industries. Book publishing: most titles lose money, but Harry Potter generated $7.7 billion in revenue for Bloomsbury. Netflix\\u0026rsquo;s viewing data through 2025 shows the top 6% of shows account for over half of viewing hours. YouTube\\u0026rsquo;s analytics through 2025 reveal that less than 4% of videos reach 10,000 views, but those videos account for over 93% of all views. The top 1% of artists earn 77% of all recorded music income. But not every industry operates in a power law world. Restaurants and airlines need consistent performance around the mean. The strategic implications: in power law domains, make many small bets. In normal distribution domains, focus on consistent execution.\\nThe internet\\u0026rsquo;s link structure follows a power law because of preferential attachment, where new nodes connect to existing nodes with probability proportional to their current connections. Albert-László Barabási and Réka Albert\\u0026rsquo;s 1999 paper showed this creates power laws with exponents around -2. The same mechanism appears throughout economic systems. Companies that are already large can invest more in R\\u0026amp;D and benefit from network effects. Research by Enrico Moretti shows that doubling city size increases productivity by 2-5% through knowledge spillovers.\\nThis raises difficult questions about income inequality. If power laws are natural features of economic systems, does that mean extreme inequality is inevitable? Power laws describe the mathematical structure, but they don\\u0026rsquo;t determine the parameters. The exponent matters enormously. A power law with exponent -1.5 means the top 1% earn roughly 10% of total income. An exponent of -2.5 means they earn roughly 30%. Current US income data from the NBER and the World Inequality Database\\u0026rsquo;s 2025 update show the US income distribution follows a power law with exponent around -1.7. The latest WID data through 2024 shows the top 1% of US earners captured approximately 20% of total income. Policy choices can influence these parameters, but they work within power law structures. They don\\u0026rsquo;t eliminate them.\\nFinancial markets show power law behavior in their crashes, creating systematic errors in risk management. Research by Xavier Gabaix and others shows that stock market drawdowns follow power laws with exponents around -3. Analysis of S\\u0026amp;P 500 data from 1928 through 2025 confirms a 10% decline happens roughly 10 times more often than a 20% decline. The pattern held through the 2022 bear market, the 2024 correction, and subsequent market movements in 2025. Traditional portfolio theory, based on Markowitz\\u0026rsquo;s mean-variance optimization, assumes normal distributions and systematically underestimates tail risk. If your model says a 20% market decline is a once-in-10,000-year event, but power laws suggest it\\u0026rsquo;s a once-in-a-decade event, your risk models are catastrophically wrong. Value at Risk (VaR) models, standard since the 1990s, are particularly vulnerable because they assume normal distributions.\\nThe 2008 financial crisis illustrated this failure. Many institutions used Gaussian copula models that assumed normal distributions. These models suggested simultaneous 20% declines across multiple regional housing markets had probabilities around 10^-11, essentially impossible. But power law analysis of historical housing data from the Case-Shiller Index shows such events occur roughly once per decade. The Federal Reserve\\u0026rsquo;s analysis confirms that regional markets exhibit power law behavior that Gaussian models miss. The models weren\\u0026rsquo;t just wrong about probabilities. They were wrong about the fundamental structure.\\nInsurance companies face a related problem. The law of large numbers works with normal distributions, but with power laws, convergence fails. A single extreme event can dominate all your other policies. In 2018, the Camp Fire in Paradise, California burned 153,000 acres, destroyed 18,800 structures, and killed 85 people. Merced Property and Casualty\\u0026rsquo;s bankruptcy filing revealed they had insured many properties in the area, but their actuarial models assumed normal distributions. When $1.3 billion in claims came in, the company had only $200 million in reserves. They went bankrupt. As of 2025, major insurers including State Farm, Allstate, and Farmers have either stopped writing new policies or significantly restricted coverage in wildfire-prone areas, with the California Department of Insurance reporting that over 1.2 million homeowners lost coverage between 2019 and 2024, a trend that has continued into 2025.\\nThis unpredictability is a feature of critical systems, not a bug. When a system is at a critical point, it\\u0026rsquo;s maximally sensitive to small changes. A single decision, trade, or policy change can cascade through the system in ways that are impossible to predict. The distribution of outcomes follows a mathematical pattern, but you can\\u0026rsquo;t know which specific outcome will occur. You can say that large crashes will occur roughly once per decade, but you can\\u0026rsquo;t say which day or which trigger will cause them.\\nFor investors and policymakers, this suggests three things. First, if you\\u0026rsquo;re operating in a power law domain, structure your strategy accordingly. Andreessen Horowitz\\u0026rsquo;s portfolio construction reflects this: their fund structure shows they make 50-100 investments per fund, knowing that 1-2 will generate most returns. Second, be deeply skeptical of models that assume normal distributions when the underlying system might follow power laws. The Basel capital requirements assume normal distributions for bank risk models, which systematically underestimates tail risk according to research by the Bank for International Settlements. Third, recognize that in critical systems, small interventions can have large effects, but you can\\u0026rsquo;t predict which will have which effects.\\nThe deeper question is whether economic systems naturally organize themselves to critical points, or whether policy can push them away from criticality. Hyman Minsky\\u0026rsquo;s financial instability hypothesis describes how financial systems naturally become more fragile over time, moving toward critical points where small shocks can trigger large crises. But unlike forest fires, economic systems are shaped by human institutions and policy choices. The challenge is that moving away from criticality might reduce the frequency of extreme events, but it could also reduce the system\\u0026rsquo;s ability to adapt and innovate. Power law distributions in venture capital mean most startups fail, but they also mean that companies that fundamentally reshape industries can emerge. Research by Jane Jacobs and Edward Glaeser shows that large cities generate innovation through density and knowledge spillovers. The question isn\\u0026rsquo;t whether power laws are good or bad. It\\u0026rsquo;s how to manage systems that exhibit them.\\nPower laws are everywhere in economic systems, and ignoring them leads to systematic errors in risk assessment, strategy, and policy. If you\\u0026rsquo;re building a portfolio using mean-variance optimization, managing a company using standard deviation as your risk metric, or designing economic policy using models that assume Gaussian shocks, you\\u0026rsquo;re assuming normal distributions. But most economic systems don\\u0026rsquo;t follow normal distributions. They follow power laws. The strategies that work in one domain will fail in the other. Most importantly, you need to recognize that in power law systems, extreme events aren\\u0026rsquo;t anomalies. They\\u0026rsquo;re inevitable features of the system\\u0026rsquo;s structure. The question isn\\u0026rsquo;t whether they\\u0026rsquo;ll occur. It\\u0026rsquo;s when, and whether you\\u0026rsquo;re prepared for them when they do. The 2008 crisis wasn\\u0026rsquo;t a black swan. Nassim Taleb\\u0026rsquo;s analysis showed it was a power law event that normal distribution models said was impossible. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission\\u0026rsquo;s final report documented how risk models systematically failed because they assumed normal distributions. The models were wrong. The events were inevitable. More recently, the 2022 market decline, the 2023 regional banking crisis, and subsequent financial stress events have demonstrated the same pattern. The Federal Reserve\\u0026rsquo;s analysis of the 2023 banking stress showed how correlated failures across multiple banks followed power law dynamics that traditional risk models missed.\\n\"","wordCount":1815,"inLanguage":"en","image":"https:\/\/static.philippdubach.com\/ograph\/ograph-powerlaws.jpg","datePublished":"2025-12-05T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-12-05T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https:\/\/philippdubach.com\/2025\/12\/05\/power-laws-criticality-and-the-economics-of-extreme-events\/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"philippdubach","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/philippdubach.com\/icons/favicon.ico"}},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Philipp Dubach"}}</script></head><body class=linkblog><div class=container><aside class=sidebar><div class=sidebar-content><div class=site-header><div class=site-title><a href=https://philippdubach.com/>philippdubach</a></div><p class=site-description>Blog about Personal Projects, Articles and Papers on Economics, Finance and Technology</p></div><nav class=navigation><ul><li><a href=/>Home</a></li><li><a href=/projects/>Projects</a></li><li><a href=/posts/>Archive</a></li><li><a href=/about/>About</a></li><li><a href=/index.xml>RSS</a></li></ul></nav><div class=social-links><a href=https://github.com/philippdubach target=_blank rel=noopener>GitHub</a>

Book publishing: most titles lose money, but Harry Potter generated <a href=https://www.statista.com/statistics/280522/revenue-of-harry-potter-franchise/>$7.7 billion in revenue</a> for Bloomsbury. <a href=https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095372/netflix-original-series-viewing-share/>Netflix&rsquo;s viewing data through 2025</a> shows the top 6% of shows account for over half of viewing hours. <a href=https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-now-watches-and-reads-along-with-you/>YouTube&rsquo;s analytics through 2025</a> reveal that less than 4% of videos reach 10,000 views, but those videos account for over 93% of all views. <a href=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/streaming-music-economy-1234817930/>The top 1% of artists earn 77% of all recorded music income</a>. But not every industry operates in a power law world. Restaurants and airlines need consistent performance around the mean. The strategic implications: in power law domains, make many small bets. In normal distribution domains, focus on consistent execution.</p><p>The internet&rsquo;s link structure follows a power law because of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment>preferential attachment</a>, where new nodes connect to existing nodes with probability proportional to their current connections. <a href=https://science.sciencemag.org/content/286/5439/509>Albert-László Barabási and Réka Albert&rsquo;s 1999 paper</a> showed this creates power laws with exponents around -2. The same mechanism appears throughout economic systems. Companies that are already large can invest more in R&amp;D and benefit from network effects. <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.104.5.260">Research by Enrico Moretti</a> shows that doubling city size increases productivity by 2-5% through knowledge spillovers.</p><p>This raises difficult questions about income inequality. If power laws are natural features of economic systems, does that mean extreme inequality is inevitable? Power laws describe the mathematical structure, but they don&rsquo;t determine the parameters. The exponent matters enormously. A power law with exponent -1.5 means the top 1% earn roughly 10% of total income. An exponent of -2.5 means they earn roughly 30%. <a href=https://www.nber.org/papers/w21199>Current US income data from the NBER</a> and <a href=https://wid.world/>the World Inequality Database&rsquo;s 2025 update</a> show the US income distribution follows a power law with exponent around -1.7. <a href=https://wid.world/>The latest WID data through 2024</a> shows the top 1% of US earners captured approximately 20% of total income. Policy choices can influence these parameters, but they work within power law structures. They don&rsquo;t eliminate them.</p><p><img src=income_distribution_exponents.png alt="Income Distribution - Power Law Exponents"></p><p>Financial markets show power law behavior in their crashes, creating systematic errors in risk management. <a href=https://www.nber.org/papers/w10523>Research by Xavier Gabaix and others</a> shows that stock market drawdowns follow power laws with exponents around -3. <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3765920">Analysis of S&amp;P 500 data from 1928 through 2025</a> confirms a 10% decline happens roughly 10 times more often than a 20% decline. The pattern held through the 2022 bear market, the 2024 correction, and subsequent market movements in 2025. Traditional portfolio theory, based on <a href=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2975974>Markowitz&rsquo;s mean-variance optimization</a>, assumes normal distributions and systematically underestimates tail risk. If your model says a 20% market decline is a once-in-10,000-year event, but power laws suggest it&rsquo;s a once-in-a-decade event, your risk models are catastrophically wrong. <a href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/var.asp>Value at Risk (VaR) models</a>, standard since the 1990s, are particularly vulnerable because they assume normal distributions.</p><p><img src=market_crash_frequency.png alt="Market Crash Frequency - Power Law"></p><p>The 2008 financial crisis illustrated this failure. Many institutions used <a href=https://www.wired.com/2009/02/wp-quant/>Gaussian copula models</a> that assumed normal distributions. These models suggested simultaneous 20% declines across multiple regional housing markets had probabilities around 10^-11, essentially impossible. But <a href=https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/indicators/sp-corelogic-case-shiller-us-national-home-price-nsa-index/#overview>power law analysis of historical housing data from the Case-Shiller Index</a> shows such events occur roughly once per decade. <a href=https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/housing-market-correlations-20190927.htm>The Federal Reserve&rsquo;s analysis</a> confirms that regional markets exhibit power law behavior that Gaussian models miss. The models weren&rsquo;t just wrong about probabilities. They were wrong about the fundamental structure.</p><p>Insurance companies face a related problem. The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers>law of large numbers</a> works with normal distributions, but with power laws, convergence fails. A single extreme event can dominate all your other policies. In 2018, the Camp Fire in Paradise, California burned <a href=https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2018/11/8/camp-fire/>153,000 acres, destroyed 18,800 structures, and killed 85 people</a>. <a href=https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2019/release003-2019.cfm>Merced Property and Casualty&rsquo;s bankruptcy filing</a> revealed they had insured many properties in the area, but their actuarial models assumed normal distributions. When <a href=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-fire-insurance/california-insurer-files-for-bankruptcy-after-camp-fire-claims-idUSKCN1Q42KZ>$1.3 billion in claims came in</a>, the company had only $200 million in reserves. They went bankrupt. <a href=https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2024/release004-2024.cfm>As of 2025, major insurers including State Farm, Allstate, and Farmers have either stopped writing new policies or significantly restricted coverage in wildfire-prone areas</a>, with <a href=https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2024/release004-2024.cfm>the California Department of Insurance reporting that over 1.2 million homeowners lost coverage</a> between 2019 and 2024, a trend that has continued into 2025.</p><p>This unpredictability is a feature of critical systems, not a bug. When a system is at a critical point, it&rsquo;s maximally sensitive to small changes. A single decision, trade, or policy change can cascade through the system in ways that are impossible to predict. The distribution of outcomes follows a mathematical pattern, but you can&rsquo;t know which specific outcome will occur. You can say that large crashes will occur roughly once per decade, but you can&rsquo;t say which day or which trigger will cause them.</p><p>For investors and policymakers, this suggests three things. First, if you&rsquo;re operating in a power law domain, structure your strategy accordingly. <a href=https://a16z.com/2014/02/14/why-software-is-eating-the-world/>Andreessen Horowitz&rsquo;s portfolio construction</a> reflects this: <a href=https://a16z.com/2021/01/27/a16z-fund-structure/>their fund structure</a> shows they make 50-100 investments per fund, knowing that 1-2 will generate most returns. Second, be deeply skeptical of models that assume normal distributions when the underlying system might follow power laws. <a href=https://www.bis.org/basel_framework/>The Basel capital requirements</a> assume normal distributions for bank risk models, which <a href=https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1509e.pdf>systematically underestimates tail risk according to research by the Bank for International Settlements</a>. Third, recognize that in critical systems, small interventions can have large effects, but you can&rsquo;t predict which will have which effects.</p><p>The deeper question is whether economic systems naturally organize themselves to critical points, or whether policy can push them away from criticality. <a href=https://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp74.pdf>Hyman Minsky&rsquo;s financial instability hypothesis</a> describes how financial systems naturally become more fragile over time, moving toward critical points where small shocks can trigger large crises. But unlike forest fires, economic systems are shaped by human institutions and policy choices. The challenge is that moving away from criticality might reduce the frequency of extreme events, but it could also reduce the system&rsquo;s ability to adapt and innovate. Power law distributions in venture capital mean most startups fail, but they also mean that companies that fundamentally reshape industries can emerge. <a href=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/294/the-death-and-life-of-great-american-cities-by-jane-jacobs/>Research by Jane Jacobs</a> and <a href=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/206193/triumph-of-the-city-by-edward-glaeser/>Edward Glaeser</a> shows that large cities generate innovation through density and knowledge spillovers. The question isn&rsquo;t whether power laws are good or bad. It&rsquo;s how to manage systems that exhibit them.</p><p>Power laws are everywhere in economic systems, and ignoring them leads to systematic errors in risk assessment, strategy, and policy. If you&rsquo;re building a portfolio using mean-variance optimization, managing a company using standard deviation as your risk metric, or designing economic policy using models that assume Gaussian shocks, you&rsquo;re assuming normal distributions. But most economic systems don&rsquo;t follow normal distributions. They follow power laws. The strategies that work in one domain will fail in the other. Most importantly, you need to recognize that in power law systems, extreme events aren&rsquo;t anomalies. They&rsquo;re inevitable features of the system&rsquo;s structure. The question isn&rsquo;t whether they&rsquo;ll occur. It&rsquo;s when, and whether you&rsquo;re prepared for them when they do. The 2008 crisis wasn&rsquo;t a black swan. <a href=https://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/>Nassim Taleb&rsquo;s analysis</a> showed it was a power law event that normal distribution models said was impossible. <a href=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf>The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission&rsquo;s final report</a> documented how risk models systematically failed because they assumed normal distributions. The models were wrong. The events were inevitable. More recently, the 2022 market decline, the 2023 regional banking crisis, and subsequent financial stress events have demonstrated the same pattern. <a href=https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2023-srcc-stress-test-results.htm>The Federal Reserve&rsquo;s analysis of the 2023 banking stress</a> showed how correlated failures across multiple banks followed power law dynamics that traditional risk models missed.</p></div></article><footer class=feedback-footer><p>Have feedback, comments, or ideas? <a href=mailto:info@philippdubach.com>I'd love to hear from you</a>.</p><p class=latest-post>Latest: <a href=/2025/12/15/book-review-why-machines-learn-by-anil-ananthaswamy/>Book Review: Why Machines Learn by Anil Ananthaswamy</a></p><p class=most-read id=top-post-week style=min-height:1.5em></p></footer><script src=/js/goatcounter-top.js></script><script>(function(){var t=document.getElementById("share-link"),e=document.getElementById("share-status");if(!t)return;t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.preventDefault(),e.textContent="...";var n,i=encodeURIComponent(window.location.href),s="yourls_"+Date.now(),o=!1;window[s]=function(t){o=!0;var i=t.shorturl;i?navigator.clipboard.writeText(i).then(function(){e.textContent="url copied",setTimeout(function(){e.textContent=""},2e3)}).catch(function(){e.textContent=i,setTimeout(function(){e.textContent=""},4e3)}):(e.textContent="error",setTimeout(function(){e.textContent=""},2e3)),delete window[s],n.parentNode&&n.parentNode.removeChild(n)},n=document.createElement("script"),n.onerror=function(){setTimeout(function(){o||(e.textContent="error",setTimeout(function(){e.textContent=""},2e3)),delete window[s],n.parentNode&&n.parentNode.removeChild(n)},500)},n.src="https://pdub.click/yourls-api.php?signature=4807288869&action=shorturl&format=jsonp&callback="+s+"&url="+i,document.body.appendChild(n)})})()</script></main></div><script>window.goatcounter=window.goatcounter||{},document.referrer&&document.referrer.includes("pdub.click")&&(window.goatcounter.no_onload=!1)</script><script data-goatcounter=https://philippdubach.goatcounter.com/count async src=https://gc.zgo.at/count.js></script></body></html>
