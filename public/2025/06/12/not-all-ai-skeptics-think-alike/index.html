</time>• <a href=https://ml-site.cdn-apple.com/papers/the-illusion-of-thinking.pdf target=_blank rel=noopener>Original Link</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Apple&rsquo;s recent paper &ldquo;The Illusion of Thinking&rdquo; has been widely understood to demonstrate that reasoning models don&rsquo;t &lsquo;actually&rsquo; reason. Using controllable puzzle environments instead of contaminated math benchmarks, they discovered something fascinating: there are three distinct performance regimes when it comes to AI reasoning complexity. For simple problems, standard models actually outperform reasoning models while being more token-efficient. At medium complexity, reasoning models show their advantage. But at high complexity? Both collapse completely.
Here&rsquo;s the kicker: reasoning models exhibit counterintuitive scaling behavior—their thinking effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines despite having adequate token budget. It&rsquo;s like watching a student give up mid-exam when the questions get too hard, even though they have plenty of time left.</p><blockquote><p>We observe that reasoning models initially increase their thinking tokens proportionally with problem complexity. However, upon approaching a critical threshold—which closely corresponds to their accuracy collapse point—models counterintuitively begin to reduce their reasoning effort despite increasing problem difficulty.</p></blockquote><p>The researchers found something even more surprising: even when they provided explicit algorithms—essentially giving the models the answers—performance didn&rsquo;t improve. The collapse happened at roughly the same complexity threshold. On the other hand <a href=https://www.seangoedecke.com/illusion-of-thinking/>Sean Goedecke</a> is not buying Apple&rsquo;s methodology: His core objection? Puzzles &ldquo;require computer-like algorithm-following more than they require the kind of reasoning you need to solve math problems.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p>You can&rsquo;t compare eight-disk to ten-disk Tower of Hanoi, because you&rsquo;re comparing &ldquo;can the model work through the algorithm&rdquo; to &ldquo;can the model invent a solution that avoids having to work through the algorithm&rdquo;.</p></blockquote><p>From his own testing, models &ldquo;decide early on that hundreds of algorithmic steps are too many to even attempt, so they refuse to even start.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strategic behavior, not reasoning failure. This matters because it shows how evaluation methodology shapes our understanding of AI capabilities. Goedecke argues Tower of Hanoi puzzles aren&rsquo;t useful for determining reasoning ability, and that the complexity threshold of reasoning models may not be fixed.</p></div></article></main></div></body></html>
