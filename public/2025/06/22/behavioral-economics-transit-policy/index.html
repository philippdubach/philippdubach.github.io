There\\u0026rsquo;s actually some solid behavioral economics behind this intuition: \\u0026ldquo;Zero as a Special Price: The True Value of Free Products.\\u0026rdquo; (Yes, before the fabricated data scandals, Ariely did write research that has replicated consistently.) The basic finding: people don\\u0026rsquo;t treat \\u0026ldquo;free\\u0026rdquo; as just another very low price. When you price something at zero, it gets a special psychological boost that makes people value it way more than they should based on pure cost-benefit analysis: Give people a choice between a Hershey\\u0026rsquo;s Kiss for 1¢ and a Lindt truffle for 15¢. Most people choose the obviously superior Lindt. Now make it Hershey\\u0026rsquo;s for free versus Lindt for 14¢—keeping the price difference exactly the same—and suddenly everyone wants the Hershey\\u0026rsquo;s. Free doesn\\u0026rsquo;t just eliminate cost; it creates additional perceived value. The mechanism is pure affect. \\u0026ldquo;Free\\u0026rdquo; makes people feel good in a way that \\u0026ldquo;1¢\\u0026rdquo; doesn\\u0026rsquo;t, even though the economic difference is trivial. When you force people to think analytically about the trade-offs, the effect disappears. But in normal decision-making, that warm fuzzy feeling of getting something for nothing dominates rational calculation.\\nThe difference between a $2.75 bus fare and $0 isn\\u0026rsquo;t meaningfully different from the difference between $2.75 and $0.75 for most riders\\u0026rsquo; budgets. But psychologically? Free transit feels like a gift from the city. Cheap transit feels like commerce. The first activates social norms (gratitude, civic participation, shared ownership). The second activates market norms (cost-benefit analysis, value-for-money calculations, consumer complaints when service is bad). On the other side, any positive price, no matter how small, forces people into analytical mode. People start thinking about trade-offs, evaluating whether the service is worth it, considering alternatives. This is why congestion pricing works so well. A $5 charge to drive in Manhattan (or Singapore, London, Stockholm, Milan, Gothenburg) isn\\u0026rsquo;t going to bankrupt anyone who can afford to drive in Manhattan. But it makes people think about each trip in a way they never did when driving felt \\u0026ldquo;free\\u0026rdquo; (ignoring gas, parking, insurance, etc.). Once you\\u0026rsquo;re thinking analytically rather than just following habit, you\\u0026rsquo;re much more likely to take the subway.\\nBut!! Free transit might actually make it easier to cut transit funding, not harder. Right now, when transit agencies face budget cuts, fare-paying riders get angry. They\\u0026rsquo;re customers! They paid for service! They demand value for money! This creates a natural constituency defending transit budgets. Make transit free, and you\\u0026rsquo;ve eliminated that market relationship. Riders become passive beneficiaries rather than paying customers. When service gets worse, they can\\u0026rsquo;t complain about not getting their money\\u0026rsquo;s worth; they\\u0026rsquo;re getting exactly what they paid for. If I were a politician looking to slash subsidies without political blowback, step one would be eliminating fares. Tell everyone it\\u0026rsquo;s about equity and access. Then, once people stop thinking of themselves as customers, start the real cuts. No more late-night service; hey, it\\u0026rsquo;s free! Longer waits, dirtier stations, broken escalators; what did you expect for nothing? The behavioral economics is clear: when something is free, people have lower expectations and less standing to complain. The zero-price effect works both ways. None of this means transit shouldn\\u0026rsquo;t be affordable!\\n\"","wordCount":642,"inLanguage":"en","image":"https:\/\/static.philippdubach.com\/ograph\/ograph-TransitPolicy.jpg","datePublished":"2025-06-22T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-06-22T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http:\/\/localhost:1313\/2025\/06\/22\/behavioral-economics-transit-policy\/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"philippdubach","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http:\/\/localhost:1313\/icons/favicon.ico"}},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Philipp Dubach"}}</script></head><body class=linkblog><div class=container><aside class=sidebar><div class=sidebar-content><div class=site-header><div class=site-title><a href=http://localhost:1313/>philippdubach</a></div><p class=site-description>Blog about Personal Projects, Articles and Papers on Economics, Finance and Technology</p></div><nav class=navigation><ul><li><a href=/>Home</a></li><li><a href=/projects/>Projects</a></li><li><a href=/posts/>Archive</a></li><li><a href=/about/>About</a></li><li><a href=/index.xml>RSS</a></li></ul></nav><div class=social-links><a href=https://github.com/philippdubach target=_blank rel=noopener>GitHub</a>
