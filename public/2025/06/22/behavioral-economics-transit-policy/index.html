As Mayor, he&rsquo;ll permanently eliminate the fare on every city bus [..] Fast and free buses will not only make buses reliable and accessible but will improve safety for riders and operators – creating the world-class service New Yorkers deserve.</p></blockquote><p>Free public transit seems to be a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_public_transport#List_of_towns_and_cities_with_area-wide_zero-fare_transport>recurring idea</a> among politicians: For some reason, making it free feels revolutionary in a way that making it cheaper never could. There&rsquo;s actually some solid behavioral economics behind this intuition: &ldquo;Zero as a Special Price: The True Value of Free Products.&rdquo; (Yes, before the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3tSG8h_O3A&amp;pp=ygUPZGFuIEFyaWVseSBmYWtl">fabricated data scandals</a>, Ariely did write research that has replicated consistently.) The basic finding: people don&rsquo;t treat &ldquo;free&rdquo; as just another very low price. When you price something at zero, it gets a special psychological boost that makes people value it way more than they should based on pure cost-benefit analysis: Give people a choice between a Hershey&rsquo;s Kiss for 1¢ and a Lindt truffle for 15¢. Most people choose the obviously superior Lindt. Now make it Hershey&rsquo;s for free versus Lindt for 14¢—keeping the price difference exactly the same—and suddenly everyone wants the Hershey&rsquo;s. Free doesn&rsquo;t just eliminate cost; it creates additional perceived value. The mechanism is pure affect. &ldquo;Free&rdquo; makes people feel good in a way that &ldquo;1¢&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t, even though the economic difference is trivial. When you force people to think analytically about the trade-offs, the effect disappears. But in normal decision-making, that warm fuzzy feeling of getting something for nothing dominates rational calculation.</p><p>Now think about bus fare policy. The difference between $2.75 and $0 isn&rsquo;t meaningfully different from the difference between $2.75 and $0.75 for most riders&rsquo; budgets. But psychologically? Free transit feels like a gift from the city. Cheap transit feels like commerce. The first activates social norms (gratitude, civic participation, shared ownership). The second activates market norms (cost-benefit analysis, value-for-money calculations, consumer complaints when service is bad). On the other side, any positive price, no matter how small, forces people into analytical mode. They start thinking about trade-offs, evaluating whether the service is worth it, considering alternatives.
This is why congestion pricing works so well. A $5 charge to drive in Manhattan (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestion_pricing>or Singapore, London, Stockholm, Milan, Gothenburg</a>) isn&rsquo;t going to bankrupt anyone who can afford to drive in Manhattan. But it makes people think about each trip in a way they never did when driving felt &ldquo;free&rdquo; (ignoring gas, parking, insurance, etc.). Once you&rsquo;re thinking analytically rather than just following habit, you&rsquo;re much more likely to take the subway.</p><p>But!! Free transit might actually make it easier to cut transit funding, not harder.
Think about it: Right now, when transit agencies face budget cuts, fare-paying riders get angry. They&rsquo;re customers! They paid for service! They demand value for money! This creates a natural constituency defending transit budgets. Make transit free, and you&rsquo;ve eliminated that market relationship. Riders become passive beneficiaries rather than paying customers. When service gets worse, they can&rsquo;t complain about not getting their money&rsquo;s worth—they&rsquo;re getting exactly what they paid for.
If I were a politician looking to slash subsidies without political blowback, step one would be eliminating fares. Tell everyone it&rsquo;s about equity and access. Then, once people stop thinking of themselves as customers, start the real cuts. No more late-night service—hey, it&rsquo;s free! Longer waits, dirtier stations, broken escalators—what did you expect for nothing? The behavioral economics is clear: when something is free, people have lower expectations and less standing to complain. The zero-price effect works both ways. None of this means transit shouldn&rsquo;t be affordable!</p></div></article></main></div></body></html>
