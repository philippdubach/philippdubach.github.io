A new study set to be published in the American Economic Review finds that active managers are slow to scoop up stocks when prices move away from their intrinsic worth. Meanwhile, the relentless boom in benchmark-tracking index funds means that each trade gets amplified, explaining how sell orders can induce broader equity gyrations.
Justina Lee for Bloomberg writes that this week&rsquo;s AI-fueled market swings perfectly illustrate the phenomenon.
