</time>• <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01970 target=_blank rel=noopener>Original Link</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Interesting new paper that builds on many of the ideas <a href=/2025/02/20/trading-on-market-sentiment/>I explored in this project</a>. The research, by Ayaan Qayyum, an <a href=https://soe.rutgers.edu/news/ayaan-qayyum-electrical-and-computer-engineering>Undergraduate Research Scholar at Rutgers</a>, shows that the core concept of using advanced language models for sentiment trading is not only viable but highly effective. The study takes a similar but more advanced approach. Instead of using a model like GPT-3.5 to generate a simple sentiment score, it uses <a href=https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embedding-models>OpenAI&rsquo;s embedding models</a> to convert news headlines into rich, high-dimensional vectors. By training a <a href=https://arxiv.org/html/2507.01970v1/extracted/6556003/diagrams/model_comb_diagram.png>battery of neural networks</a></p><blockquote><p>included Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), and a Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN). All were implemented using PyTorch</p></blockquote><p>on these embeddings alongside economic data, the study found it could <a href=https://arxiv.org/html/2507.01970v1/extracted/6556003/diagrams/models_ranked_smape.png>reduce prediction errors by up to 40%</a> compared to models without the news data.</p><p>The most surprising insight ro me, and one that directly addresses the challenge of temporal drift I discussed, was that Qayyum&rsquo;s time-independent models performed just as well, if not better, than the time-dependent ones. By shuffling the data, the models were forced to learn the pure semantic impact of a headline, independent of its specific place in time. This suggests that the market would react to the substance of news in consistent ways, even if the narratives themselves change.</p></div></article></main></div></body></html>
