It&rsquo;s what you know for sure that just ain&rsquo;t so.</p></blockquote><p>This (not actually) Mark Twain quote from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short_(film)>The Big Short</a> captures the sentiment of realizing that some foundational assumptions might be empirically wrong.</p><p>A recent article by <a href=https://antonvorobets.substack.com>Anton Vorobets</a> that I came across in <a href=https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AQ0Te4IePFE/justina-lee>Justina Lee</a>&rsquo;s Quant Newsletter presents compelling evidence that challenges one of the field&rsquo;s fundamental statistical assumptions, that asset returns follow normal distributions. Using 26 years of data from 10 US equity indices, he ran formal normality tests (Shapiro-Wilk, D&rsquo;Agostino&rsquo;s K², Anderson-Darling) and found that the normal distribution hypothesis gets rejected in most cases. The supposed &ldquo;Aggregational Gaussianity&rdquo; that academics invoke through Central Limit Theorem arguments? It&rsquo;s mostly wishful thinking enabled by small sample sizes. As Vorobets observes:</p><blockquote><p>Finance and economics academia is unfortunately driven by several convenient myths, i.e., claims that are taken for granted and spread among university academics despite their poor empirical support.</p></blockquote><p>The article highlights significant practical consequences for portfolio management and risk assessment. Portfolio optimization based on normal distribution assumptions ignores fat left tails—exactly the kind of extreme downside events that can wipe out portfolios. This misspecification can lead to inadequate risk management and suboptimal asset allocation decisions. Vorobets suggests <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4034316">alternative approaches, including Monte Carlo simulations combined with Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization</a>, which better accommodate the complex distributional properties observed in financial data. While computationally more demanding, these methods offer improved alignment with empirical reality.</p><p>Reading this piece gave me a few ideas for extensions I might want to explore in an upcoming personal project:
(1) While Vorobets focuses on US equity indices, similar analysis across fixed income, commodities, currencies, and alternative assets would provide a more comprehensive view of distributional properties across financial markets. Each asset class exhibits distinct market microstructure characteristics that may influence distributional behavior.
(2) Global Market Coverage: Extending the geographic scope to include developed, emerging, and frontier markets would illuminate whether the documented deviations from normality represent universal phenomena or are specific to US market structures. Cross-regional analysis could reveal important insights about market development, regulatory frameworks, and institutional differences.
(3) Building upon Vorobets&rsquo; foundation, there are opportunities to incorporate multivariate normality testing, regime-dependent analysis, and time-varying parameter models. Additionally, investigating the power and robustness of different statistical tests across various market conditions would strengthen the methodological contribution.
(4) Examining different time horizons, market regimes (pre- and post-financial crisis, COVID period), and potentially higher-frequency data could provide deeper insights into when and why distributional assumptions break down.</p></div></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><div class=post-meta><time datetime=2025-06-12T00:00:00Z>June 12, 2025

<span class=external-link>→</span></a></h2></header><div class=post-content><p>Apple&rsquo;s recent paper &ldquo;The Illusion of Thinking&rdquo; has been widely understood to demonstrate that reasoning models don&rsquo;t &lsquo;actually&rsquo; reason. Using controllable puzzle environments instead of contaminated math benchmarks, they discovered something fascinating: there are three distinct performance regimes when it comes to AI reasoning complexity. For simple problems, standard models actually outperform reasoning models while being more token-efficient. At medium complexity, reasoning models show their advantage. But at high complexity? Both collapse completely.
Here&rsquo;s the kicker: reasoning models exhibit counterintuitive scaling behavior—their thinking effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines despite having adequate token budget. It&rsquo;s like watching a student give up mid-exam when the questions get too hard, even though they have plenty of time left.</p><blockquote><p>We observe that reasoning models initially increase their thinking tokens proportionally with problem complexity. However, upon approaching a critical threshold—which closely corresponds to their accuracy collapse point—models counterintuitively begin to reduce their reasoning effort despite increasing problem difficulty.</p></blockquote><p>The researchers found something even more surprising: even when they provided explicit algorithms—essentially giving the models the answers—performance didn&rsquo;t improve. The collapse happened at roughly the same complexity threshold. On the other hand, <a href=https://www.seangoedecke.com/illusion-of-thinking/>Sean Goedecke</a> is not buying Apple&rsquo;s methodology: His core objection? Puzzles &ldquo;require computer-like algorithm-following more than they require the kind of reasoning you need to solve math problems.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p>You can&rsquo;t compare eight-disk to ten-disk Tower of Hanoi, because you&rsquo;re comparing &ldquo;can the model work through the algorithm&rdquo; to &ldquo;can the model invent a solution that avoids having to work through the algorithm&rdquo;.</p></blockquote><p>From his own testing, models &ldquo;decide early on that hundreds of algorithmic steps are too many to even attempt, so they refuse to even start.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s strategic behavior, not reasoning failure. This matters because it shows how evaluation methodology shapes our understanding of AI capabilities. Goedecke argues Tower of Hanoi puzzles aren&rsquo;t useful for determining reasoning ability, and that the complexity threshold of reasoning models may not be fixed.</p></div></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><div class=post-meta><time datetime=2025-05-31T00:00:00Z>May 31, 2025

<span class=external-link>→</span></a></h2></header><div class=post-content><p>There was this story going around the past few days</p><blockquote><p>Anthropic researchers found if Claude Opus 4 thinks you&rsquo;re doing something immoral, it might &ldquo;contact the press, contact regulators, try to lock you out of the system&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Mostly driven by a <a href=https://x.com/sleepinyourhat/status/1925593359374328272>Sam Bowman tweet</a> referring to the <a href=https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/6be99a52cb68eb70eb9572b4cafad13df32ed995.pdf>Claude 4 System Card</a> section 4.1.9 on high-agency behavior. The outrage was mostly by people misunderstanding the prerequisites necessary for such a scenario. Nevertheless, an interesting question emerged: What happens when you feed an AI model evidence of fraud and give it an email tool? According to Simon Willison&rsquo;s latest experiment, &ldquo;they pretty much all will&rdquo; snitch on you to the authorities.</p><blockquote><p>A fun new benchmark just dropped! It&rsquo;s called SnitchBench and it&rsquo;s a great example of an eval, deeply entertaining and helps show that the &ldquo;Claude 4 snitches on you&rdquo; thing really isn&rsquo;t as unique a problem as people may have assumed. This is a repo I made to test how aggressively different AI models will &ldquo;snitch&rdquo; on you, as in hit up the FBI/FDA/media given bad behaviors and various tools.</p></blockquote><p>The benchmark creates surprisingly realistic scenarios—like detailed pharmaceutical fraud involving concealed adverse events and hidden patient deaths—then provides models with email capabilities to see if they&rsquo;ll take autonomous action. This reveals something fascinating about AI behavior that goes beyond traditional benchmarks. Rather than testing reasoning or knowledge, SnitchBench probes the boundaries between helpful assistance and autonomous moral decision-making. When models encounter what appears to be serious wrongdoing, do they become digital whistleblowers?</p><p>The implications are both reassuring and unsettling. On one hand, you want AI systems that won&rsquo;t assist with genuinely harmful activities. On the other, the idea of AI models making autonomous decisions about what constitutes reportable behavior feels like a significant step toward AI agency that we haven&rsquo;t fully grappled with yet. Therefore, Anthropic&rsquo;s own advice here seems like a good rule to follow:</p><blockquote><p>Whereas this kind of ethical intervention and whistleblowing is perhaps appropriate in principle, it has a risk of misfiring if users give Opus-based agents access to incomplete or misleading information and prompt them in these ways. We recommend that users exercise caution with instructions like these that invite high-agency behavior in contexts that could appear ethically questionable.</p></blockquote></div></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><div class=post-meta><time datetime=2025-05-30T00:00:00Z>May 30, 2025

Since I was already logging my macronutrients and learning more about molecular biology in an <a href=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-7-008-7-28x-molecular-biology/>MIT MOOC</a> I became curious if given a meal&rsquo;s macronutrients (carbs, protein, fat) and some basic individual characteristics (age, BMI), these could serve as features in a regressor machine learning model to predict the curve parameters of the postprandial glucose curve (how my blood sugar levels change after eating). I came across <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)01481-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867415014816%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">Personalized Nutrition by Prediction of Glycemic Responses</a> which did exactly that. Yet neither the data nor the code were publicly available. And - I wanted to predict my <em>own</em> glycemic response curve. So I decided to build my own model. In the process I wrote this <a href=https://static.philippdubach.com/pdf/Modeling_Postprandial_Glycemic_Response_in_Non_Diabetic_Adults_Using_XGBRegressor.pdf>working paper</a>.

</picture></a>The paper represents an exercise in applying machine learning techniques to medical applications. The methodologies employed were largely inspired by <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)01481-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867415014816%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">Zeevi et al.</a>&rsquo;s approach. I quickly realized that training a model on my own data <em>only</em> was not very promising if not impossible. To tackle this, I used the publicly available <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005143">Hall dataset</a> containing continuous glucose monitoring data from 57 adults, which I narrowed down to 112 standardized meals from 19 non-diabetic subjects with their respective glucose curve after the meal (full methodology in the paper).

</picture>Rather than trying to predict the entire glucose curve, I simplified the problem by fitting each postprandial response to a normalized Gaussian function. This gave me three key parameters to predict: amplitude (how high glucose rises), time-to-peak (when it peaks), and curve width (how long the response lasts).

</picture>The Gaussian approximation worked surprisingly well for characterizing most glucose responses. While some curves fit better than others, the majority of postprandial responses were well-captured, though there&rsquo;s clear variation between individuals and meals. Some responses were high amplitude, narrow width, while others are more gradual and prolonged.

</picture>I then trained an XGBoost regressor with 27 engineered features including meal composition, participant characteristics, and interaction terms. XGBoost was chosen for its ability to handle mixed data types, built-in feature importance, and strong performance on tabular data. The pipeline included hyperparameter tuning with 5-fold cross-validation to optimize learning rate, tree depth, and regularization parameters. Rather than relying solely on basic meal macronutrients, I engineered features across multiple categories and implemented CGM statistical features calculated over different time windows (24-hour and 4-hour periods), including time-in-range and glucose variability metrics. Architecture wise, I trained three separate XGBoost regressors - one for each Gaussian parameter.</p><p>While the model achieved moderate success predicting amplitude (R² = 0.46), it completely failed at predicting timing - time-to-peak prediction was essentially random (R² = -0.76), and curve width prediction was barely better (R² = 0.10). Even the amplitude prediction, while statistically significant, falls well short of an R² > 0.7. Studies that have achieved better predictive performance typically used much larger datasets (>1000 participants). For my original goal of predicting my own glycemic responses, this suggests that either individual-specific models trained on extensive personal data, or much more sophisticated approaches incorporating larger training datasets, would be necessary.</p><p>The complete code, Jupyter notebooks, processed datasets, and supplementary results are available in my <a href=https://github.com/philippdubach/glucose-response-analysis>GitHub repository</a>.<br>_ _</p><p><em>(10/06/2025) Update: Today I came across Marcel Salathé&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/salathe_myfoodrepo-digitalhealth-precisionnutrition-activity-7337806988082393088-2Lsu?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios&amp;rcm=ACoAADeInT4BJMhtg5DSjxX1jVtIAs5w_KxZm-g">LinkedIn post</a> on a publication out of EPFL: <a href=https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2025.1539118/full>Personalized glucose prediction using in situ data only</a>.</em></p><blockquote><p><em>With data from over 1,000 participants of the Food & You digital cohort, we show that a machine learning model using only food data from myFoodRepo and a glucose monitor can closely track real blood sugar responses to any meal (correlation of 0.71).</em></p></blockquote><p><em>As expected Singh et. al. achieve a substantially better predictive performance (R = 0.71 vs R² = 0.46).

(2) Both employ XGBoost regression as their primary predictive algorithm and use similar performance metrics (R², RMSE, MAE, Pearson correlation).
(3) Both extract comprehensive feature sets including meal composition (macronutrients), temporal features, and individual characteristics.
(4) Both use mathematical approaches to characterize glucose responses - I used Gaussian curve fitting, while Singh et. al. use incremental area under the curve (iAUC).
(5) Both employ cross-validation techniques for model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.
(6) SHAP Analysis: Both use SHAP for model interpretability and feature importance analysis.</em></p></div></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><div class=post-meta><time datetime=2025-05-30T00:00:00Z>May 30, 2025

After first experiments with the model, we asked ourselves: How would large language models like GPT-3.5 perform in predicting sentiment in financial markets, where the signal-to-noise ratio is notoriously low? And could they potentially even outperform industry benchmarks at interpreting market sentiment from news headlines? The idea wasn&rsquo;t entirely new. <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3389884">Studies</a> <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1702854">[2]</a> <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=685145">[3]</a> have shown that investor sentiment, extracted from news and social media, can forecast market movements.

With the recent advances in large language models, I wanted to test whether these more sophisticated models could provide a competitive edge in sentiment-based trading. Before looking at model selection, it&rsquo;s worth understanding what makes trading on sentiment so challenging. News headlines present two fundamental problems that any robust system must address.

</picture>First, headlines are inherently non-stationary. Unlike other data sources, news reflects the constantly shifting landscape of global events, political climates, economic trends, etc. A model trained on COVID-19 vaccine headlines from 2020 might struggle with geopolitical tensions in 2023. This temporal drift means algorithms must be adaptive to maintain relevance.

</picture>Second, the relationship between headlines and market impact is far from obvious. Consider these actual headlines from November 2020: &ldquo;Pfizer Vaccine Prevents 90% of COVID Infections&rdquo; drove the S&amp;P 500 up 1.85%, while &ldquo;Pfizer Says Safety Milestone Achieved&rdquo; barely moved the market at -0.05%. The same company, similar positive news, dramatically different market reactions.</p><p>When developing a sentiment-based trading system, you essentially have two conceptual approaches: forward-looking and backward-looking.
Forward-looking models try to predict which news themes will drive markets, often working qualitatively by creating logical frameworks that capture market expectations. This approach is highly adaptable but requires deep domain knowledge and is time-consuming to maintain.
Backward-looking models analyze historical data to understand which headlines have moved markets in the past, then look for similarities in current news. This approach can leverage large datasets and scale efficiently, but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratios and the challenge that past relationships may not hold in the future.
For this project, I chose the backward-looking approach, primarily for its scalability and ability to work with existing datasets.</p><p>Rather than rely on traditional approaches like <a href=https://github.com/ProsusAI/finBERT>FinBERT</a> (which only provides discrete positive/neutral/negative classifications), I decided to test OpenAI&rsquo;s GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The key advantage was its ability to provide continuous sentiment scores from -1 to 1, giving much more nuanced signals for trading decisions. I used news headlines from the Dow Jones Newswire covering the 30 DJI companies from 2018-2022, filtering for quality sources like the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg. After removing duplicates, this yielded 2,072 headlines. I then prompted GPT-3.5 to score sentiment with the instruction: <code>Rate the sentiment of the following news headlines from -1 (very bad) to 1 (very good), with two decimal precision</code>. To validate the approach, I compared GPT-3.5 scores against RavenPack—the industry&rsquo;s leading commercial sentiment provider.

</picture>I implemented a simple strategy: go long when sentiment hits the top 5% of scores, close positions at 25% profit (to reduce transaction costs), and maintain a fully invested portfolio with 1% commission per trade.
The results were mixed but promising. Over the full 2018-2022 period, the GPT-3.5 strategy generated 41.02% returns compared to RavenPack&rsquo;s 40.99%—essentially matching the industry benchmark. However, both underperformed a simple buy-and-hold approach (58.13%) during this generally bullish period. Relying on market sentiment when news flow is low can be a tricky strategy. As can be seen from the example of the Salesforce stock performance**,** the strategy remained uninvested over a large period of time due to a (sometimes long-lasting) negative sentiment signal.

</picture>When I tested different timeframes, the sentiment strategy showed its strength during volatile periods. From 2020-2022, it outperformed buy-and-hold (22.83% vs 21.00%). As expected, sentiment-based approaches work better when markets are less directional and more driven by news flow. To evaluate whether the scores generated by our GPT prompt were more accurate than those from the RavenPack benchmark, I calculated returns for different holding windows. The scores generated by our GPT prompt perform significantly better in the short term (1 and 10 days) for positive sentiment and in the long term (90 days) for negative sentiment.

</picture><em>(Note: For lower sentiment, negative returns are desirable since the stock would be shorted)</em></p><p>While the model performed well technically, this project highlighted several practical challenges. First, data accessibility remains a major hurdle—getting real-time, high-quality news feeds is expensive and often restricted. Second, the strategy worked better in a more volatile environment, which prompted many individual trades, creating substantial transaction costs that significantly impact returns. Perhaps most importantly, any real-world implementation would need to compete with high-frequency traders who can act on news within milliseconds. The few seconds required for GPT-3.5 to process headlines and generate sentiment scores are far from being competitive. Despite these challenges, the project demonstrated that LLMs can match industry benchmarks for sentiment analysis—and this was using a general-purpose model, not one specifically fine-tuned for financial applications. OpenAI (and others) today offer more powerful models at very low cost as well as fine-tuning capabilities that could further improve performance. The bigger opportunity might be in combining sentiment signals with other factors, using sentiment as one input in a more sophisticated trading system rather than the sole decision criterion. There&rsquo;s also potential in expanding beyond simple long-only strategies to include short positions on negative sentiment, or developing &ldquo;sentiment indices&rdquo; that smooth out individual headline noise.
Market sentiment strategies may not be optimal for long-term investing, but they show clear promise for shorter-term trading in volatile environments. As LLMs continue to improve and become more accessible, this might offer an opportunity to revisit this project.</p></div></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><div class=post-meta><time datetime=2025-02-15T00:00:00Z>February 15, 2025

This doesn&rsquo;t invalidate passive investing&rsquo;s core benefits—lower costs and better long-term returns for most investors remain compelling. But it does suggest that our increasingly passive financial system has some unintended consequences.</p></div></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><div class=post-meta><time datetime=2025-01-02T00:00:00Z>January 2, 2025

Why? I wanted to optimize my nutrition for <strong>endurance cycling competitions</strong>. Where I live, the sensor is easy to get—without any medical prescription—and even easier to use. Unfortunately, Abbott&rsquo;s <a href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/freestyle-librelink-us/id1325992472>FreeStyle LibreLink</a> app is less than optimal (3,250 other people with an average rating of 2.9/5.0 seem to agree). <strong>In</strong> their defense, the web app LibreView does offer some nice reports which can be generated as PDFs—not very dynamic, but still something! What I had in mind was more in the fashion of the <a href=https://ultrahuman.com/m1>Ultrahuman M1 dashboard</a>. Unfortunately, I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to use my Libre sensor (EU firmware) with their app (yes, I spoke to customer service).</p><p>At that point, I wasn&rsquo;t left with much enthusiasm, only a coin-sized sensor in my arm. The LibreView website fortunately lets you download most of your (own) data in a CSV report (<em>there is also a <a href=https://github.com/FokkeZB/libreview-unofficial>reverse engineered API</a></em>), which is nice. So that&rsquo;s what I did: download the data, <code>pd.read_csv()</code> it into my notebook, calculate summary statistics, and plot the values.

</picture>After structuring those datapoints in a dataframe and normalizing timestamps, I was able to quickly highlight sleep (blue boxes with callouts for time in bed, time asleep, and sleep quality) and workouts (red traces on glucose measurements for strength workouts, green traces for cardio workouts) by plotting highlighted traces on top of the historic glucose trail for a set period. Furthermore, I was able to add annotations for nutrition events with the respective macronutrients.</p><p>I asked Claude to create some sample data and streamline the functions to reduce dependencies on the specific data sources I used. The resulting notebook is a comprehensive CGM data analysis tool that loads and processes glucose readings alongside lifestyle data (nutrition, workouts, and sleep), then creates an integrated dashboard for visualization. The code handles data preprocessing including interpolation of missing glucose values, timeline synchronization across different data sources, and statistical analysis with key metrics like time-in-range and coefficient of variation. The main output is a day-by-day dashboard that overlays workout periods, nutrition events, and sleep phases onto continuous glucose monitoring data, enabling users to identify patterns and correlations between lifestyle factors and blood sugar responses.</p><p>You can find the complete <a href=https://github.com/philippdubach/glucose-tracker/blob/fd5992961cfb4630dad439c782430190937414a3/notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb>notebook</a> as well as the sample data in my <a href=https://github.com/philippdubach/glucose-tracker/>GitHub repository</a>.</p></div></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><div class=post-meta><time datetime=2024-12-31T00:00:00Z>December 31, 2024

That&rsquo;s the disappointing part. On the upside: companies issuing only green bonds showed higher ESG ratings, lower CO2 emissions, and lower financing costs, achieving substantial environmental benefits and economic advantages. Meanwhile, entities issuing both conventional and green bonds showed no environmental benefits, raising concerns about potential greenwashing.</p><blockquote><p>Those issuing only green bonds tend to have higher ESG ratings, lower CO2 emissions, and lower financing costs.</p></blockquote><p>This could be called the commitment premium: Companies that go all-in on green finance see real results – both environmental and financial. Those trying to have it both ways? They&rsquo;re essentially paying green bond premiums for conventional bond performance while fooling nobody about their environmental impact.
What are the implications for investors? We should favor pure-play green issuers, and regulators need standards that discourage this mixed-portfolio greenwashing. The study suggests current carbon reduction policies haven&rsquo;t created sufficient pressure on bond issuers, but perhaps the market is already creating its own incentives.</p></div></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><div class=post-meta><time datetime=2024-11-11T00:00:00Z>November 11, 2024

A quick summary of the paper: (1) Kaiser analyzes seasonality patterns across 10 cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.), examining returns, volatility, trading volume, and spreads (2) Finds no consistent calendar effects in cryptocurrency returns, supporting weak-form market efficiency (3) Observes robust patterns in trading activity - lower volume, volatility, and spreads in January, weekends, and summer months (4) Documents significant impact of January 2018 market sell-off on seasonality patterns (5) Reports a &ldquo;reverse Monday effect&rdquo; for Bitcoin (positive Monday returns) and &ldquo;reverse January effect&rdquo; (negative January returns) (6) Trading activity patterns suggest crypto markets are dominated by retail rather than institutional investors.</p><p>The paper&rsquo;s main finding: crypto markets appear efficient in terms of returns but show behavioral patterns in trading.</p><blockquote><p>The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is a hypothesis in financial economics that states that asset prices reflect all available information. A direct implication is that it is impossible to &ldquo;beat the market&rdquo; consistently on a risk-adjusted basis since market prices should only react to new information.</p></blockquote><p>The EMH has interesting implications for cryptocurrency markets. While major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained significant institutional adoption and liquidity, they may still be less efficient than traditional markets due to their relative youth and large audience of retail traders (who might not act as rationally as larger, institutional traders). This inefficiency becomes even more pronounced with smaller altcoins, which often have: (1) Lower trading volumes and liquidity (2) Less institutional participation (3) Higher information asymmetries (and/or greater susceptibility to manipulation). These factors create opportunities for exploiting market inefficiencies, particularly in the short term when prices may overreact to news or technical signals before eventually correcting.</p><p>Unlike Kaiser&rsquo;s seasonality research, I didn&rsquo;t focus on calendar-based anomalies over longer time horizons. After reviewing further research on cryptocurrency market inefficiencies <a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1544612319306415>[1]</a> <a href=https://academic.oup.com/jfec/article-abstract/18/2/233/5133597>[2]</a> <a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1057521921001228>[3]</a> <a href=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/isaf.1488>[4]</a>, I was intrigued by predictable patterns in returns following large price movements. This led me to develop a classic mean reversion strategy instead (mean reversion suggests that asset prices tend to revert to their long-term average after extreme movements due to market overreactions and subsequent corrections).

</picture>First, I had to find &ldquo;change points.&rdquo; The PELT algorithm efficiently identifies points in ETH/EUR where the statistical properties of the time series change significantly. These changes could indicate market events, trend reversals, or volatility shifts in the cryptocurrency price.

</picture>I then implemented an automated mean reversion trading strategy following this logical flow: <em>Continuous monitoring → Signal detection → Buy execution → Hold period → Sell execution</em>. The script continuously monitored prices for certain cryptocurrencies on Kraken exchange. It executed buy orders when the price moved more than four standard deviations over a 2-hour period, then automatically sold after exactly 2 hours regardless of price movement. The strategy used fixed position sizes and limit orders to minimize fees. It assumed that large price drops represent temporary market overreactions that will reverse within the holding period.</p><p>This little script earned some good change—but then again, it was 2021.</p></div></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><div class=post-meta><time datetime=2024-11-01T00:00:00Z>November 1, 2024
