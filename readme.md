# Linkblog

## About

I started this in 2024 as a simple way to collect interesting articles and papers that catch my attention. Each post includes a link, title, and my brief commentary or summary.

This collection helps me maintain a personal repository of articles and papers, practicing my writing through short summaries, and motivating myself to complete small weekend projects by sharing them in a structured way.

The site runs on Hugo and is hosted on GitHub Pages.
